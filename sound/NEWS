Fiddling about with audio files.  aRTs 0.6.0 support is there,
ALSA 0.9 MIDI support and JACK 0.34 support.  At the moment we're
building up the audio infrastructure towards complete audio
integration with better JACK (sync'd) support and then 
implement aRts 1.0.0 interface (again sync'd audio and MIDI).
