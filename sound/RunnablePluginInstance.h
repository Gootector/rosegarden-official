/**
 * RunnablePluginInstance is a very trivial interface that an audio
 * process can use to refer to an instance of a plugin without needing
 * to know what type of plugin it is.
 *
 * The audio code calls run() on an instance that has been passed to
 * it, and assumes that the passing code has already initialised the
 * plugin, connected its inputs and outputs and so on, and that there
 * is an understanding in place about the sizes of the buffers in use
 * by the plugin.  All of this depends on the subclass implementation.
