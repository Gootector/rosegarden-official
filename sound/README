The sound/ subsys offers MIDI interfaces (files and events),
aRTS interfaces (MIDI and audio) and sequencing support.

Two libs are built from this directory:

  libRosegardenSound     - general sound support (audio and midi files)
  libRosegardenSequencer - sequencer specific support

The test apps miditest and audiotest show off some of the
features of these libraries.
