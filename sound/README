To compile:

- try a plain ./configure

- cross your fingers

The configure isn't set up at all well but it sometimes
works - sometimes complains about LIBTOOL - just try the
make again!  Dependencies seem to be OK but we're currently
checking for way too much stuff.

If it compiles it creates a test executable (script to a libtool'd
executable) called "sound" that'll read in a MIDI file and attempt
to get an aRts Midi Manager connection and read some events from
the MIDI IN.
