 * This context is used to 
 *      - See when a repeating segment may be cam ne print inside
 *        repeat bars. (i.e. when no other unrepeating segment
 *        coexists at the same time on an other track).
 *      - Compute the time offset which have to be set il LilyPond for
 *        each segment (with keyword \skip).
