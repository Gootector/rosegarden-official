/**
 * MappedEventBuffer is the container class for sound-making events
 * that have been mapped linearly into memory for ease of reading by
 * the sequencer code (after things like tempo mappings, repeats etc
 * have been mapped and unfolded).
 *
 * The mapping logic is handled by mappers derived from this class; this
 * class provides the basic container and the reading logic.  Reading
 * and writing may take place simultaneously without locks (we are
 * prepared to accept the lossage from individual mangled MappedEvent
 * reads) but a read/write lock on the buffer space guards against bad
 * access caused by resizes.
 *
 * MappedEventBuffer only concerns itself with the state of the
 * composition, as opposed to the state of performance.  No matter how
 * the user jumps around in time, it shouldn't change.  For the
 * current state of performance, see MappedEventBuffer::iterator.
 *
 * A MappedEventBuffer is jointly owned by one or more metaiterators
 * and by ChannelManager and deletes itself when the last owner is
 * removed.
 *
