/// Abstract Base Class container for MappedEvent objects.
/**
 * MappedEventBuffer is an Abstract Base Class.  Consequently,
 * MappedEventBuffer objects are never created.  See the three
 * derived classes: MetronomeMapper, SegmentMapper, and
 * SpecialSegmentMapper.
 *
 * MappedEventBuffer is the container class for sound-making events
 * that have been mapped linearly into memory for ease of reading by
 * the sequencer code (after things like tempo mappings, repeats etc
 * have been mapped and unfolded).
 *
 * The mapping logic is handled by mappers derived from this class; this
 * class provides the basic container and the reading logic.
 *
 * Reading and writing may take place simultaneously without locks (we are
 * prepared to accept the lossage from individual mangled MappedEvent
 * reads) but a read/write lock (m_lock) on the buffer space guards
 * against bad
 * access caused by resizes.  [Actually, it doesn't at all since the
 * caller of peek() has a pointer they can access after the lock has
 * been released.  See comments on m_lock below and in iterator::peek().]
 *
 * MappedEventBuffer only concerns itself with the state of the
 * composition, as opposed to the state of performance.  No matter how
 * the user jumps around in time, it shouldn't change.  For the
 * current state of performance, see MappedEventBuffer::iterator.
 *
 * A MappedEventBuffer-derived object is jointly owned by one or more
 * metaiterators (MappedBufMetaIterator?) and by ChannelManager and deletes
 * itself when the last owner is removed.  See addOwner() and removeOwner().
