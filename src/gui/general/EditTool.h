/**
 * Edit tool base class.
 *
 * A EditTool represents one of the items on an edition view
 * toolbar. It handles mouse click events for the EditView ('State'
 * design pattern).
 *
 * A EditTool can have a menu, normally activated through a right
 * mouse button click. This menu is defined in an XML file, see
 * NoteInserter and noteinserter.rc for an example.
 *
 * This class is a "semi-singleton", that is, only one instance per
 * EditView window is created. This is because menu creation is
 * slow, and the fact that a tool can trigger the setting of another
 * tool through a menu choice). This is maintained with the
 * EditToolBox class This means we can't rely on the ctor/dtor to
 * perform setting up, like mouse cursor changes for instance. Use the
 * ready() and stow() method for this.
 *
 * @see EditView#setTool()
 * @see EditToolBox
