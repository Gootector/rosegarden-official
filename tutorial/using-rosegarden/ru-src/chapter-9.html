<H1>In The Next Edition</H1>
<P>I have lost all interest in writing this for the moment, and I
just want to get it finished, done, put to bed and out the door, so I
can go work on some bugs and try to get Rosegarden 1.0 itself
finished, done, put to bed and out the door.  There are a number of
things I didn't cover in this first edition.  If someone wants to
pick this up for publication, I may write them.  If not, then what
you have is what you have for the time being.  I will need to write
an updated version for 1.1 anyway, and I hope to get into some of the
areas I have left uncovered at that time.</P>
<P>Some things I didn't mention:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>importing Hydrogen patterns</P>
	<LI><P>merging MIDI files</P>
	<LI><P>using the audio file manager/managing audio projects</P>
	<LI><P>mastering (&quot;bounce to disk&quot;)</P>
	<LI><P>various notation hack workarounds to accomplish things in
	spite of some of the limitations of this initial release of the
	notation editor</P>
	<LI><P>???</P>
</UL>
<P>All of this and more will come in due time, but not tomorrow, not
next week, not next month.  Maybe spring 2005.  I have done little
else for two months but work on this book, and I am just not in the
groove anymore.  It is too forced, and it is time to let it rest a
bit.</P>
