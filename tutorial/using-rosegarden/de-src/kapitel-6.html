	<P>Jack is short for the &ldquo;Jack Audio Connection Kit.&rdquo; 
	This marvel is at the heart of Linux audio, and it allows for a
	level of interoperability between applications that's undreamt of in
	the world of proprietary  software.  Jack is the cement that binds
	together a host of varied applications, and lets them all work
	together seamlessly.</P>
	<P>This chapter will discuss starting the jackd server, configuring
	connections with qjackctl, and getting a variety of applications
	such as Timidty, QSynth, Hydrogen, JamIn, and ZynAddSubFX to play
	nicely together.  I'm under severe time constraints at the moment,
	and I don't have time to do this very complex subject justice before
	my deadline.</P>
