<P>CHANGES ABOVE THIS LINE OK, CHANGES BELOW THIS LINE SHOULD BE
DISCUSSED WITH SILVAN</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><B>Foreword:</B></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><B>Dear Reader: You are reading a work
in progress. It's coming along quite nicely, but I still have miles
to go. Please forgive the mess at the end, and all the links that
don't go anywhere yet. Keep checking back, as this document gets
better with age.</B></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><B>The material in Chapters 1-4 is, for
the most part, at a point where I consider it mature and complete,
therefore suggestions, corrections and pointing out outright
stupidity on my part are welcome, as I will not be doing much to that
material from here forward unless someone calls my attention to
problems.</B></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><B>Chapters 5 on are still up in the
air, and there may yet be some re-organization. I don't like getting
into depth with segments so late, but I don't want to put the cart
before the horse, and there's nothing to <I>do</I> with segments in
Chapter 2 unless I can the whole project and start off with recording
into newly-created segments first. I have a gazillion painstakingly
inserted pixmaps that depend on a certain flow. I've already run into
some continuity problems due to the shuffling done to date. I'm
probably going to introduce segments in Chapter 5 and be done with
it.</B></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><B>Now, enough administrativa. Have a
look at what's been done so far. I hope that, even in its present,
immature state, it can be a useful resource to those getting to know
Rosegarden.</B></P>

<H1 ALIGN=LEFT><A NAME="Introduction"></A>1. Introduction</H1>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal">My goal in writing this
tutorial is to learn through teaching. You and I are in this together
every step of the way. I'm a writer, not a programmer, and much of
the inner working of Rosegarden is just as much of a magical mystery
to me as it is to you. In short, I'm a user, just like you, with user
problems and a user perspective.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>My aim here is not to write an exhaustive technical
manual that covers every single possibility in dry detail. This is a
meandering journey through Rosegarden, taking you through a
real-world project one concept at a time, and showing you things of
interest along the way. I expect that once I've lead you to water,
you can choose a spot from which to drink for yourself. I hope that
by sharing my experiences with you, we'll both be able to get more
out of time spent with Rosegarden.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>This tutorial assumes that you have a recent version of
Rosegarden 4, and that it's working properly. I leave it to you to
surf to the <A HREF="http://www.all-day-breakfast.com/rosegarden/download.html">Rosegarden
download</A> page and work outward from there. Several distros
already have a rosegarden4 or rosegarden-4 package available through
mainstream or third-party channels, and if it isn't already, yours
will probably be among them soon.</P>
<P><I>NOTE: Rosegarden is under constant development. As such, some
minor details or screenshots described here may not exactly match the
software in front of you. I do my best to keep up, but the act of
documenting a work in progress involves a certain amount of
obsolescence.</I></P>
<H2><A NAME="Sample-Project"></A>1.1 Our Sample Project</H2>
<P>One of the most important personal uses I have for Rosegarden is
creating playable scores and accompaniment for my own musical
purposes. I have precious little contact with musical people, and so
I make heavy use of my computer as an accompanist in a variety of
ways.</P>
<P>One of my most common projects involves taking a MIDI file, then
arranging it so that there's an interesting part I can play on my
flute. I print a score from which to play, and record myself playing
along with the accompaniment. Ideally, I like to play as many live
instruments as possible, so I'll record myself playing parts on
guitar, bass, and sometimes even the didgeridoo. I've based this
tutorial around just this sort project, because it should cover most
of the things that you might want to do with Rosegarden, whether your
own approach to music bears any resemblance to mine or not.</P>
<P>I begin these projects with a wide variety of source material, but
for the purpose of this tutorial, I will stick with a completely
original composition, so as to avoid any potential copyright issues.
Inspiration to compose only strikes me a few times a decade, and I'm
not currently inspired. As such, I'm pulling something out of the
archives. This may not be a<B> </B><I>good</I> composition, but I own
the rights to it, and can mangle it any way I choose without fear of
any consequence more dire than rotten food being thrown at my head.</P>
<P>I composed it for eventual inclusion in a computer game. So you
can follow along at home, you can get a copy of the file here:
<A HREF="midi/ultima.mid">ultima.mid</A> This file was last touched
with a sequencer running on a completely different platform, and
affords us the opportunity to deal with some of the issues involved
when importing foreign files into Rosegarden.</P>
<P>The piece is short and simple, intended to be looped as background
music for an adventure game. I gave no particular thought to ever
playing this live on real instruments, and it's quite likely that
none of the parts will be playable on the instruments I assigned to
them. It should be interesting to see what we can do with it in
Rosegarden.</P>
<H2>1.2 The Author's Studio</H2>
<P>Obviously, I can only show you what I can do myself, and that is
hardware dependant. I'd like you to bear in mind what is sitting in
front of me as I write this, and thus I will share the details of my
&ldquo;studio.&rdquo; 
</P>
<P>I'm running a 1.0 GHz Athlon system with 256 MB of RAM. The box
runs Debian Woody with aftermarket KDE 3.0.3 from a third-party
apt-source, and a variety of other add-ons that I've had to compile
for myself along the way in order to get my build environment in line
for bleeding edge software such as Rosegarden. I'm running a
completely stock kernel 2.4.19 that has had no patches applied. (I
probably should apply the low-latency patch, but I'm working on a
nice uptime record...)</P>
<P>On the audio side of things, my sole soundcard is a Sound Blaster
PCI 128, driven by ALSA 0.9.0rc6 and Jack from CVS, with Woody's
supplied LADSPA SDK and plugins.</P>
<P>On the MIDI side of things, I have a joystick port MIDI box for
the Sound Blaster, to which I attach a Fatar MIDI-72 controller
keyboard and a Roland SC-33 Sound Canvas. All of the source MIDI
files that I work with in this tutorial were sequenced to make use of
this particular GS synth, and as such, some of what I say in that
area will not apply or even make sense to you if you're using an XG
or other synth to follow along.</P>
<P>In addition to the Roland, I'm running an IWU Soft Synth via
iiwusynth 0.2.2. Details of getting these working successfully are
covered in the <A HREF="http://faq.html/">FAQ.</A> I have it compiled
against Jack, but have not yet managed to actually get the two to
co-exist.</P>
<P>I run Rosegarden from CVS, which I compile frequently.</P>

but I've given you enough of a hint to get there if you dig for it a
bit. :)</P>

<H2><A NAME="StartingRosegarden"></A>2.1 Starting Rosegarden</H2>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Let's begin by starting Rosegarden, and having a look
at the <B>Main Window</B>. This is where you get an overall view of
your composition, and control a number of settings and parameters.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><I><FONT SIZE=1 STYLE="font-size: 8pt">TIP: You might

it can sometimes be a reassurance to see it working when Rosegarden
is processing something particularly hefty and is too busy to bother
re-painting its window.</FONT></I></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal">In order to share a common
frame of reference, let's turn on anything that isn't already
displayed by default.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">Use the
<B>Settings</B> menu to toggle these options. Observe that I had not
toggled on the <B>Chord Name Ruler</B> when I took this snapshot.
Also note that this is, unsurprisingly, where a number of Rosegarden
settings can be configured. We'll come back to some of those later
on:</P>

<H2><A NAME="MainWindowOverview"></A>2.2 Main Window Overview</H2>
<P>In the <B>Main Window</B>, just below the menu, you will see
the...</P>
<P><B>Toolbars</B>. In addition to the usual standard controls, 
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="font-weight: medium"><IMG SRC="pixmaps/common-toolbar.png" NAME="Graphic39" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=278 HEIGHT=28 BORDER=0></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">there are several toolbars you won't
have seen elsewhere. You'll choose various cursors from the <B>Cursor
Toolbar</B>,</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="font-weight: medium"><IMG SRC="pixmaps/cursors-toolbar.png" NAME="Graphic40" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=210 HEIGHT=27 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">and there's a subset of

<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="font-weight: medium"><IMG SRC="pixmaps/mini-transport.png" NAME="Graphic41" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=211 HEIGHT=29 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">Next in line is the <B>Zoom</B>
slider:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="font-weight: medium"><IMG SRC="pixmaps/zoom.png" NAME="Graphic42" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=270 HEIGHT=27 BORDER=0></P>
<P>Moving down into the window itself, you'll find the <B>Segment
Parameters Pane</B>, where several segment playback parameters can be
set:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="font-weight: medium"><IMG SRC="pixmaps/segment-parameters.png" NAME="Graphic33" ALT="Segment Parameters" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=242 HEIGHT=137 BORDER=0></P>
<P>The <B>Tracklist</B>, where you manipulate your sequence on a

<IMG SRC="pixmaps/mute-button.png" NAME="Graphic34" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=14 HEIGHT=17 BORDER=0>,
to allow you to mute individual tracks, and a<B> Record Button </B>

<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Now we move into the meat of things with the <B>Segment Pane</B>,
where a lot of editing operations take place. At the top, you'll find
the various <B>Rulers</B>,</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="font-weight: medium"><IMG SRC="pixmaps/rulers.png" NAME="Graphic44" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=251 HEIGHT=82 BORDER=0></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">Then the <B>Segment Pane</B> itself,
which is currently empty. We'll do a lot with this later.</P>

<H2><A NAME="TheStudio"></A>2.3 The Studio</H2>
<P>Before importing anything, we're going to want to set up
instrument definitions for all of our MIDI devices so that nothing
gets lost in the translation.</P>
<P>The <B>Studio</B> is where this is done, and it's important. It's
also so much in flux at the time of this writing that I'm glossing
over it for the moment. I'll come back to it directly. 
</P>
<H1>3. Let the Games Begin</H1>
<P>Let's quit looking, and start <I>using</I> Rosegarden. It's time
to import that <A HREF="http://midi/ultima.mid">midi file</A> that I
mentioned previously. Use the <B>File -&gt; Import -&gt; Import MIDI
File...</B> menu to navigate to this file, and then open it.</P>
<P>Once imported, your screen should resemble this. If it doesn't,
take another look at the <B>Settings</B> menu and toggle all the
optional displays on: 
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A HREF="pixmaps/snapshot1.png"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><IMG SRC="pixmaps/snapshot1.png" NAME="Graphic1" ALT="screenshot" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=256 HEIGHT=192 BORDER=2></FONT></A></FONT><A HREF="pixmaps/snapshot1.png">
</A>
</P>
<P>While we're at it, let's go ahead and split these huge segments
into smaller pieces so that we can manipulate them later.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Use <B>Edit -&gt; Select All Segments</B>
from the menu to highlight all of the segments. Then use <B>Segments
-&gt; Auto-Split</B> to automatically split them, eliminating
sections of silence, and leaving you with little islands of notey
bits. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="font-weight: medium"><IMG SRC="pixmaps/segments-autosplit.png" NAME="Graphic51" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=359 HEIGHT=252 BORDER=0></P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>To get a better overview of the composition, use the <B>Zoom</B>
slider to zoom out a bit.</P>
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="pixmaps/zoom.png" NAME="Graphic30" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=270 HEIGHT=28 BORDER=0></H2>
<P>Your screen should then resemble this:

<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A HREF="snapshot4.png"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><IMG SRC="pixmaps/snapshot4.png" NAME="Graphic7" ALT="screenshot" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=256 HEIGHT=192 BORDER=2></FONT></A></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Now that we've imported the file, let's see how it
fared. Rosegarden is not purely a MIDI sequencer, and a certain
amount of translation takes place when importing MIDI files into
Rosegarden's internal format. Sometimes this introduces minor
problems that need to be corrected, which we will address directly.</P>
<H2>3.1 Transport Tools</H2>
<P>First, we need to see what it sounds like. Let's get to know the
<B>Transport</B> window, and the<B> Playback Pointer</B>,<B> </B>which
are two of the tools we'll use to get around in our compositions.</P>
<P>Notice that there's a vertical blue bar in the <B>Segment Pane</B>
of the main window. That is the <B>Playback Pointer</B>. You can move
it to any arbitrary point in the composition by clicking on the <B>Ruler</B>
at the top, or you can use the <B>Transport</B> to move it around. If
you don't see it, play with the <B>Transport</B> or the <B>Ruler
</B>until you move it out of hiding.</P>
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="font-weight: medium"><IMG SRC="pixmaps/playback-pointer.png" NAME="Graphic31" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=104 HEIGHT=198 BORDER=0></H2>
<P>You'll initially have a separate, floating <B>Transport</B> window
like this one.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="pixmaps/snapshot2.png" NAME="Graphic2" ALT="Transport Window" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=428 HEIGHT=161 BORDER=0></P>
<P>Most of these should be self-explanatory. If you can't figure out
what any of the buttons do, hover over them a bit, and
context-sensitive help will pop up. Of special note are the<B> Panic</B>,<B>
Metronome</B>,<B> </B>and<B> Solo </B>buttons. If they're missing,
toggle the &ldquo;flap&rdquo; via the 
<IMG SRC="pixmaps/flap-toggle.png" NAME="Graphic48" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=25 HEIGHT=26 BORDER=0>
button.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><I><IMG SRC="pixmaps/transport-play-panic.png" NAME="Graphic15" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=135 HEIGHT=52 BORDER=0></I></P>
<P>The <B>Panic</B> button transmits an &ldquo;all notes off&rdquo;
message. Use it, for example, when your synth has gotten a note stuck
and the incessant droning of that low F# is driving you up the wall.</P>
<P>The <B>Metronome</B> does what you'd probably expect. You can turn
the metronome on during normal playback, as well as recording, and it
is a useful tool to use when practicing playing along with your
composition.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">The <B>Solo</B> button mutes all
tracks except for the one that's currently selected, allowing you a
convenient way to hear just one part. (To &ldquo;solo&rdquo; more
than one part, at present, you'll need to set the mute for tracks
individually. The <B>Solo</B> button only affects a single track.)</P>
<H2>3.2 Tweaking the Import</H2>
<P>Find the<B> Play/Pause </B>button and give this composition a
listen. It's very likely that it will sound somewhat lame initially.
That's the result of a few issues that Rosegarden needs a bit of help
to work around.</P>
<P>This file was created with Cakewalk, and it includes a SysEx bank
that would have set up the reverb level and various other paremeters
on my synth. That has been lost. It includes percussion on two
separate channels, which is why you're hearing those raunchy piano
notes in the bass (that track was assigned to channel 9), and it's
supposed to use the &ldquo;OrcheSet&rdquo; drum kit on my synth. The
program change on channel 10 was lost.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>So, before you write me off as a terrible composer,
let's get this back to the condition it was in when it left Cakewalk
last year. We need to correct for what has been lost in the
translation from raw MIDI to Rosegarden's internal format, and then
we'll play with it.</P>
<P>The first thing we really need to do is fix the percussion. The
most direct way to accomplish this is to assign the &ldquo;Conga&rdquo;
track to the same device and channel as the previous track.</P>
<P>Click on the &ldquo;Conga&rdquo; track name, and hold the button
down for a moment. Navigate through the various available devices
until you find channel 10. Your results will vary depending on a
number of variables, but here's what it looks like here: <I>(Note
that the &ldquo;Dummy MIDI Device&rdquo; will be changing to
something more useful soon.)</I></P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="pixmaps/fix-conga.png" NAME="Graphic49" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=450 HEIGHT=319 BORDER=0></P>
<P>Now, we really need to change the drum kit. At this time,
Rosegarden can't yet cope with having GS-style named drumkits on
channel 10. It's on the table, but no decision has yet been made as
to exactly how best to implement it. Until then, we'll have to live
with having an instrument listed instead of our drumkit.</P>
<P>I jumped the gun in taking the above snapshot. Note that I have
already assigned the &ldquo;Strings&rdquo; program to this channel.
It so happens that &ldquo;Strings&rdquo; corresponds to the correct
program number I need to use in order to switch my Sound Canvas to
the &ldquo;OrcheSet&rdquo; drumkit.</P>
<P>In order for you to do the same at home, click on either the
&ldquo;Conga&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Orchestral bass, crash &amp; snare&rdquo;
track name to select it. (Remember that they're both bound to the
same device and channel, so a change made to one will affect the
other.) Now click on the <B>Program</B> button in the <B>Instrument
Parameters </B>pane.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="pixmaps/ins-params.png" NAME="Graphic50" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=175 HEIGHT=249 BORDER=0></P>
<P>If the <B>Program </B>checkbox isn't checked, check it. Now you
can scroll through with your mouse wheel, or select a name from the
drop-down list. It's helpful if your synth has a display so that you
can see when you happen to get to the correct program number. In this
case, &ldquo;Strings&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Capital Tones&rdquo; bank
is what we're after.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="pixmaps/dropdown.png" NAME="Graphic5" ALT="dropdown list" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=202 BORDER=0>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">Of course your mileage with all of this
will surely vary depending on your synth. You may not have the option
of changing this at all, or may need to use a completely different
method for changing it. XG users, I've learned, will need to use
bank, rather than program changes, to change drum kits. Soft synth
users and others who can make use of them will probably want to load
an appropriate soundfont. Something medievalish would be tasty.
Season to to suit yourself.</P>
<P>Now that the drums are a little more interesting, it's starting to
sound better, but there's still work to do. We need to make up for
that lost SysEx bank by cranking up the reverb.</P>
<H2 ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal">3.3 Instrument Parameters</H2>
<P>The SysEx bank that Cakewalk included with this file has been lost
in the translation. Luckily, Rosegarden makes it easy to set the
initial values for the most common controllers right there in the
<B>Instrument Parameters</B> pane. If you didn't notice this before,
take note of the knobs in this pane. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><I><IMG SRC="pixmaps/instrument-parameters.png" NAME="Graphic6" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=351 HEIGHT=285 BORDER=0></I></P>
<P>Let's select each track in turn, and dial up the 'verb. Click on
the <B>Reverb</B> knob and either use your mouse wheel or else drag
the cursor in a straight horizontal or vertical line (don't try to
drag it around in a circle) to change the position of the knob. Crank
it up. You can never have too much reverb. Now lather, rinse, repeat
until every track has major 'verbage. (Or reverbificate to taste, if
you insist on having less than maximal 'verbage...) 
</P>
<P>Depending on your synth's implementation, some of these knobs may
not actually be useful to you. If any of these knobs don't seem to
have any effect, blame it on your synth.</P>
<P>Now is a good time to save. Remember to <B><U>save early, save
often</U></B>. Rosegarden is still under heavy development, and it's
not fun to see your work evaporate. If you do discover a bug, try to
determine a way to repeat it consistently, and let the Rosegarden
team know about it. 
</P>
<H1>4. Let's Edit Some Notation</H1>
<P>For the next phase in our sample project, we want to look at what
is necessary to make the flute part in this composition playable on a
real flute, and then print a score. In this chapter, we'll make some
basic changes to the part and work on cleaning up the humanized
performance data so that it renders as more tidy notes. Later on, in
Chapter 5, we'll add some new material to this part to make it more
exciting to play.</P>
<H2 ALIGN=LEFT>4.1 Opening the Notation Editor</H2>
<P>Let's get a look at what this part looks like in notation. It will
probably be ugly, since I recorded it on my keyboard instead of
entering it note by note. 
</P>
<P>Let's open the <B>Notation Editor</B> and have a look. Highlight a
segment from the &ldquo;Flute&rdquo; track.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="pixmaps/flute-segment.png" NAME="Graphic52" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=268 HEIGHT=88 BORDER=0></P>
<P>Open the <B>Notation Editor</B> by right-clicking on the segment,
and choosing &ldquo;<B>Edit as Notation</B>&rdquo; from the context
submenu. You can also configure this to be your default view via
<B>Settings -&gt; Configure Rosegarden... -&gt; Default Editor</B>,
and thereafter you can get to the <B>Notation Editor</B> by merely
double-clicking the desired segment.</P>
<H2>4.2 Notation Editor Overview</H2>
<P>We'll be spending a lot of time here in the <B>Notation Editor</B>.
As you'd expect, this is where you go to view and edit your data as
standard notation. This editor has many more features than I will
make use of for my purposes here, but this should be enough of an
introduction for you to get wherever you want to be with your own
projects.</P>
<P>The first thing you'll notice is that there are different toolbars
here. Before looking, let's synchronize our displays. You may not yet
have a <B>Transport Toolbar</B> for this window. Check <B>Settings -&gt;
Show Transport Toolbar</B> and the <B>Transport Toolbar</B> should
appear. It would be a good idea to use <B>Settings -&gt; Save
Settings</B> at this point so that it remains there, as it's very
useful.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Now, let's have a look at the new
toolbars. You can toggle several of these via the <B>Toggle Toolbar</B></P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="font-weight: medium"><IMG SRC="pixmaps/notation-toolbar-toggles.png" NAME="Graphic57" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=123 HEIGHT=26 BORDER=0></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">The <B>Cursor Toolbar</B> has three
cursors, <B>Erase</B>, <B>Select</B>, and <B>Text</B>.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="font-weight: medium"><IMG SRC="pixmaps/notation-cursors-toolbar.png" NAME="Graphic53" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=95 HEIGHT=28 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">The <B>Note Duration</B>
<B>Toolbar</B> has both regular and dotted flavors of several note
lengths, plus toggles for <B>Chord Insert Mode</B> and <B>Triplet
Insert Mode</B>, which should be self-explanatory. With the <B>Select</B>
cursor highlighted, you can click on a duration and then click on the
staff to insert a note.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">You can toggle accidentals
via the <B>Accidentals Toolbar</B>,</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="font-weight: medium"><IMG SRC="pixmaps/notation-accidentals-toolbar.png" NAME="Graphic56" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=182 HEIGHT=27 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">or you can add rests via
the <B>Rests Toolbar...</B></P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><IMG SRC="pixmaps/notation-rests-toolbar.png" NAME="Graphic55" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=418 HEIGHT=27 BORDER=0></B></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">Add clefs via the <B>Clefs
Toolbar</B>,</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="font-weight: medium"><IMG SRC="pixmaps/notation-clefs-toolbar.png" NAME="Graphic58" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=123 HEIGHT=28 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">and you can change the font
used to render the notes via this little gadget here:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="font-weight: medium"><IMG SRC="pixmaps/notation-font-dongle.png" NAME="Graphic59" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=124 HEIGHT=27 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">The &ldquo;RG 2.1&rdquo;
font isn't as pretty, but it renders more quickly than feta, so may
be useful on slower hardware.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">Use <B>ctrl-Z</B> or <B>Edit
-&gt; Undo</B> to remove the results of your having played with these
things.</P>
<H3>4.2.1 Controlling Playback</H3>
<P>The <B>Transport Toolbar</B> that we turned on in the preceding
section is the same as in every other window, with two notable
exceptions, which is why I've saved it until now. These extra buttons
are useful for controlling playback when the <B>Playback Pointer</B>
is outside the segment you're editing, and you want to hear what
you're working on.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="pixmaps/notation-transport-toolbar.png" NAME="Graphic54" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=240 HEIGHT=28 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>If you haven't moved it, the <B>Playback Pointer</B> is
at or near the beginning of the composition. This part doesn't come
in until much later, so if we hit the <B>Play</B> button now, we
can't expect to hear anything for awhile.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">The <B>Notation Editor</B>
has its own cursor, which is just like the one in the <B>Segment Pane</B>
of the <B>Main Window</B>, except that this one is magenta. In order
to control playback, you need to be able to manipulate both cursors,
and those two extra buttons on the end of the toolbar help you do
just that.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Let's move the playback cursor to the
beginning of this segment. Click on the ruler above the staff to
position the local cursor, just as the ruler in the <B>Main Window</B>
positions the <B>Playback Pointer</B> itself. Click the <B>Playback
Pointer to Cursor 
<IMG SRC="pixmaps/notation-pointer-to-cursor.png" NAME="Graphic14" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=29 HEIGHT=28 BORDER=0>
</B>button to move the playback pointer to the position of the
cursor. Now playback will begin from that point.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">You can set it back &ldquo;out of
sight&rdquo; so that playback will begin before the start of the
segment you're editing by shifting it to the left via the 
<IMG SRC="pixmaps/notation-rewind.png" NAME="Graphic17" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=33 HEIGHT=31 BORDER=0>
button.</P>
<H3>4.2.2 Changing the View</H3>
<P>Notice the <B>Size</B>, <B>Spacing</B>, and <B>Smoothing</B>
sliders. (They're camera shy for some reason, and come out black. I'm
sure you'll have no problem figuring out what I'm talking about.)</P>
<P>The <B>Size</B> slider changes the size of the font used to render
the notes.</P>
<P>The <B>Spacing</B> slider can be used to adjust the horizontal
spacing of the notes, to draw them closer or further apart. Useful
for spreading out particularly complicated rhythms for easier
reading.</P>
<P>The <B>Smoothing</B> slider is useful for cleaning up performance
data somewhat, to make it more legible.</P>
<P>All of these controls are also available from the <B>View</B>
menu.</P>
<H2>4.3 Transposing</H2>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Now that we've had our bit of fun playing with all the
new toys, let's look at the part and see what it's going to need.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="pixmaps/notation-yucky-notes.png" NAME="Graphic9" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=467 HEIGHT=128 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Gack! This definitely should have been a piccolo part.
My head hurts just looking at this stuff. Let's transpose it down an
octave and see what it looks like. Let's make that <B>two</B>
octaves! I can get that high with my flute, but my dog would hate me.
Two octaves are good.</P>
<P>Select <B>Edit -&gt; Select Whole Staff</B>, then go to the
<B>Transforms</B> menu.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="pixmaps/transforms-transpose.png" NAME="Graphic60" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=246 HEIGHT=230 BORDER=0></P>
<P>Lots of good stuff to play with here, take note, but we want
<B>Transpose...</B> Since we're going to go down two octaves, we
might as well go for the <B>Transpose...</B> option at the bottom.
Use the arrows to dial down, or else enter -24 into the input box.
Positive numbers mean an upward transposition, and negative numbers
will transpose downward.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="pixmaps/transpose-box.png" NAME="Graphic10" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=408 HEIGHT=115 BORDER=0></P>
<H2>4.4 De-Humanizing</H2>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Now that we're down to a reasonable
register, let's do something about the ugly notes. The problem with
human performance data is that it doesn't scale well into notation.
You'll notice that some of the notes are displaying in yellow. That's
because they're notes whose timing and duration don't quite make
sense to Rosegarden within the context of this measure, so it has
colored them to let you know that the notes on the page are only an
approximation of what will actually be played. To see a view of the
data in a more pure format, use the <B>Matrix</B> or <B>Event List</B>
editors, which we'll take a look at later on.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Since our objective here is to make
the notation more readable, we might as well remain here and alter
the data until it better fits into place within the context of
notation. In this instance, readability is more important to us than
the faithful rendering of a human performance, so we're going to end
up making &ldquo;physical&rdquo; changes to the data along the way.</P>
<H3>4.4.3 Smoothing</H3>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Let's start by seeing what that
<B>Smoothing</B> slider can do for us... Each notch makes the rhythm
progressively less obnoxious to read, leaving the notes in place.
Adjust the slider, and see what results. I found that the final notch
was too high, and the next lower notch was looking better, but wasn't
really quite there.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Let's try making these smoothed values
permanent. Select the whole staff, and let's try <B>Transform -&gt;
Fix Smoothed Values</B>...</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="pixmaps/post-fix-smoothed.png" NAME="Graphic12" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=630 HEIGHT=123 BORDER=0></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Well, that didn't quite have the
desired effect, did it? The timings are still too far off. Remember
<B>ctrl-Z</B> is a shortcut for <B>Edit -&gt; Undo</B>.</P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>4.4.2 Quantize</H3>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">I think this data is so messy that
we're going to have to quantize it. Let's <B>Undo</B> that last
change, and play with <B>Transform -&gt; Quantize</B> instead. Let's
tell it to <B>Quantize: Event positions, and round durations to exact
notes</B>. We'll leave the <B>Base duration unit</B> at 16<SUP>th</SUP>,
and accept the default <B>Note rounding</B> values and see where that
gets us:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="pixmaps/quantize.png" NAME="Graphic13" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=468 HEIGHT=250 BORDER=0></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Not too bad. It's looking much better:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="font-weight: medium"><IMG SRC="pixmaps/post-quantized.png" NAME="Graphic18" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=466 HEIGHT=128 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">Let's see how those changes
sound, and then we'll see about turning those 16<SUP>th</SUP>
note/rest pairs into something a little easier to read...</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">The quantized notes seem to
have fallen into place along sane boundaries without having an undue
impact on the rhythm or feel of the piece. Bearing that in mind,
let's back up a step and see what would have happened if we had
quantized on 8<SUP>th</SUP> note boundaries. Hit<B> ctrl-Z</B> or use<B>
Edit -&gt; Undo</B>, then run through the<B> Transformations -&gt;
Quantize</B> dialog again, specifying a base duration of 8<SUP>th</SUP>
note this time around.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">Very nice indeed, and
Rosegarden has rendered some 16<SUP>th</SUP> notes and other odd bits
as required, ignoring the base duration when it really had to. That's
one of the best jobs of quantization I've seen in a notation editor.
There won't be much clean-up to do from here:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="font-weight: medium"><IMG SRC="pixmaps/post-quantized2.png" NAME="Graphic19" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=360 HEIGHT=78 BORDER=0></P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>4.4.4 Adding Marks</H3>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">We've changed the flavor
somewhat by lengthening those notes. Let's make them staccato. There
isn't currently an icon for this, but you'll find it on the menu.
First you'll need to make a selection.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">If it's not already the
default, choose the<B> Select</B> cursor 
<IMG SRC="pixmaps/notation-selection-cursor.png" NAME="Graphic24" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=51 HEIGHT=55 BORDER=0>
from the<B> Toolbar</B>. Click at a point to the left of one of the
notes to begin the selection.<B> </B>Drag the blue selection box so
that it includes the first two 8<SUP>th</SUP> notes. When they're
selected, they'll turn blue. Now use <B>Marks -&gt; Add Staccato</B>.
The dots appear:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="font-weight: medium"><IMG SRC="pixmaps/post-quantized3.png" NAME="Graphic20" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=280 HEIGHT=64 BORDER=0></P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>4.4.5 Auto-Beam</H3>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">Now let's add beams. <B>Edit
-&gt; Select Whole Staff</B>, then <B>Group -&gt; Auto Beam</B> to
beam these notes into logical groupings:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="font-weight: medium"><IMG SRC="pixmaps/post-quantized4.png" NAME="Graphic21" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=348 HEIGHT=94 BORDER=0></P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>4.4.6 Changing Note Durations</H3>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">One measure further into
the segment, there are some rhythms that could probably be written so
that they're less awkward to count. Let's see about changing them.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">There's an odd dotted 16<SUP>th</SUP>
with 32<SUP>nd</SUP> rest combination that should probably be another
stacatto 8<SUP>th</SUP> note:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="pixmaps/post-quantized5.png" NAME="Graphic22" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=584 HEIGHT=94 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">Let's convert that into an
8<SUP>th</SUP> note. Click the 8<SUP>th</SUP> note button 
<IMG SRC="pixmaps/notation-8th-note-button.png" NAME="Graphic25" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=53 HEIGHT=52 BORDER=0>
on the <B>Notes Toolbar</B>, then click on the offending dotted 16<SUP>th</SUP>
note's head. It changes into an 8<SUP>th</SUP> note, and the rest
disappears. <I>Note that Rosegarden pads out the rests as necessary,
to keep the correct time in the measure. </I>
</P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>4.4.7 Let's Add Some Slurs</H3>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">Let's add some slurs as
well. Highlight the first two 8<SUP>th</SUP> notes in this measure,
then use <B>Group -&gt; Add Slur</B>. You should be looking at
something very like this:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="font-weight: medium"><IMG SRC="pixmaps/post-quantized6.png" NAME="Graphic23" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=398 HEIGHT=84 BORDER=0></P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>4.4.8 Manual Beaming</H3>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">Now let's do two more
things to enhance readability. I'm used to reading beamed groups that
count out to one beat. Let's separate those two groups, and add
another slur. Select the first two 8<SUP>th</SUP> notes in that
four-note group, then use <B>Group -&gt; Beam Group</B> to fuse those
two together. The remaining two notes adapt automatically, and remain
beamed. Now select all four of the 8<SUP>th</SUP> notes plus the half
note and add a slur. Finally, notice that the note stems are in the
way of the slur. Let's select the second pair of 8<SUP>th</SUP> notes
and use <B>Notes -&gt; Stem Direction -&gt; Stems Down</B> or else
<B>ctrl-PageDown</B> to change their direction. You should wind up
with a measure resembling this one:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="font-weight: medium"><IMG SRC="pixmaps/post-quantized7.png" NAME="Graphic26" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=350 HEIGHT=112 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">Continue in this fashion
until you finish altering the notation so that it's nice and tidy. I
think you should have a pretty good idea how to proceed from here, so
I'm not going to walk you through the rest of this job.</P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>4.4.9 The Text Cursor</H3>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">Now let's add some
directions. Exchange your <B>Select</B> cursor for a <B>Text 
<IMG SRC="pixmaps/text-cursor.png" NAME="Graphic16" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=34 BORDER=0></B>cursor.
Click toward the beginning of the staff, near the clef. Let's start
by adding a tempo and a dynamic of ff, (since my dynamic range is
from ff to fffff :). Click the cursor where you want the text to
appear, then configure it via the dialog.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>-getrg-</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>Adventuresome people--especially Debian
users--wanting to play with the CVS may wish to take a look at my
</I><A HREF="get-rg.tar.gz"><I>get-rg</I></A><I> script. I'm not
going to go into detail on how to use it, or how to alter it to suit </I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>-track edit-</P>
<P>Let's pause a moment in our tour to play with the <B>Tracklist</B>,
though we'll be importing tracks later on and over-writing anything
we do here. Click on the <B>&lt;untitled&gt;</B> in one of the
tracks, and you'll see an instrument configuration dialog like this
one where you can choose the device and channel for the track. Your
menus will almost certainly differ, but this is what mine looks like
with default<B> Studio</B> settings,<B> </B>without my soft synth
running:</P>

<P>Change track names by double-clicking on the label. A dialog
should thus appear:</P>

2.7 A Look at Segments</H2>
<H3>2.7.1 About Segments</H3>
<P>We've created and fiddled around with a segment, but what <I>is </I>a
segment? They allow you to arrange portions of your composition with
ease. You can slide MIDI events and audio samples around at will, cut
them up, re-combine them, overlap them, and so on, giving you a high
degree of control over the your composition.</P>
<P>Many operations in Rosegarden take place at the segment level.</P>
<P>Take another look at the <B>Segment Pane</B> to the right, now
that it's displaying something interesting.</P>
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="pixmaps/segment-pane.png" NAME="Graphic29" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=502 HEIGHT=284 BORDER=0></H2>
<P>Let's start by cutting out all the empty spaces, and cutting these
huge segments into smaller pieces. 
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>2.7.2 Segment Previews</H3>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Look closely, and you'll notice that each one of the
segments contains a miniature &ldquo;matrix&rdquo; or &ldquo;piano
roll&rdquo; view. You can get some sense of what that bit of music is
like just by looking at the segment display, which is a useful visual
aid when dragging things around. If this feature is not turned on,
turn it on with <B>Settings -&gt; Segment Previews</B>. Later, we'll
see that we can also manipulate audio segments in similar fashion.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="font-style: normal"><IMG SRC="pixmaps/snapshot5.png" NAME="Graphic8" ALT="enlarged view of segments" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=501 HEIGHT=283 BORDER=0>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal">Now, let's overlap the
segments. Select the &ldquo;Conga&rdquo; segment, and drag it up to
the &ldquo;Orchestral bass, crash &amp; snare&rdquo; track. 
</P>
<P>Your screen should now resemble this: 
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#000080"><A HREF="post-overlap-layer.png"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><IMG SRC="pixmaps/post-overlap-layer.png" NAME="Graphic4" ALT="screenshot" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=256 HEIGHT=192 BORDER=2></FONT></A></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>For now, we'll leave the &ldquo;Conga&rdquo; track in
place. The layering we've done gets both of these tracks into the
same MIDI channel with aplomb, but we may need to drag the big track
back out so that we can more readily get to the smaller ones beneath.
I don't see a way to select a segment that's buried entirely beneath
another segment.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Now that the drum kit has been corrected and both drum
parts are playing on the correct channel, it's starting to shape up.
The only thing missing is reverb. It sounds rather dull without it.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>-more segment stuff-</P>
<P>Then you'll see segments for all of your tracks. Let's create one.</P>
<P>To create one, click in one of the tracks. A segment one measure
long will appear,</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="pixmaps/short-segment.png" NAME="Graphic45" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=537 HEIGHT=91 BORDER=0></P>
<P>which you can resize with the <B>Resize Cursor</B> 
<IMG SRC="pixmaps/resize-cursor.png" NAME="Graphic46" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=31 HEIGHT=27 BORDER=0>
to extend it a few bars:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="font-weight: medium"><IMG SRC="pixmaps/resize-segment.png" NAME="Graphic47" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=519 HEIGHT=88 BORDER=0></P>
<P>Well, that should be enough of an introduction to give you
something to play with. Let's move onto actually <I>doing</I>
something with a few of these gadgets. We'll be doing more with the
<B>Main Window</B> later.</P>
<H2 ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal">--segment parameters--</H2>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Segment Parameters</H2>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>There are several ways to transpose in Rosegarden,
depending on what you want to do. If you just want to affect
playback, you can configure the transposition in the <B>Segment
Parameters</B> pane of the main window. This allows you to add a
playback delay, on-the-fly quantization, segment repeat or, of
course, transposition for any segment. Now is a good time to play
with these, and see some of the things they can do, though we can't
use them for the task at hand, since they only affect performance.</P>
