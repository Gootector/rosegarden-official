</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><I>Dear Reader: You are reading a work in
 progress. It's coming along quite nicely, but I still have miles to go.
 Please forgive the mess, and keep checking back, as this document gets
 better with age, just like Rosegarden itself.</I></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><I>Rosegarden is changing too fast for me
 to keep pace, and so I've given up trying. This document focuses on
 what Rosegarden-4 0.8.5 can do. It will be updated to reflect major
 changes in Rosegarden when it becomes worthwhile to do so. I'm shooting
 for a major re-write with version 1.0, and thereafter on a schedule
 matching major release numbers, but I may address specific issues in
 certain sections sooner, on an as-needed basis. If you are using CVS,
 or a newer version than 0.8.5 you will probably have features available
 that are not mentioned here, and your screens may look different.</I></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><I>Now, enough administrativa. Have a
 look at what's been done so far. I hope that, even in its present,
 immature state, this guide can be a useful resource for those getting
 to know Rosegarden.</I></P>

 Introduction</A></H1>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="1_1">1.1 What is Rosegarden?</A></H2>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-style: normal">Rosegarden-4, hereafter
 referred to as simply Rosegarden, is a versatile application that seeks
 to be a useful tool for those wanting to create music. It combines
 aspects of a MIDI sequencer, an audio sequencer, and a notation editor
 into one convenient, easy to use package that provides users with a
 consistent interface.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-style: normal">It is a native KDE
 application that can run on any system that has the KDE and QT
 libraries installed, and currently requires a minimum of KDE/QT 3.0 in
 order to run. Due to its dependence on ALSA, the Advanced Linux Sound
 Architecture, it is probably only useful to those running Linux
 systems, but it is designed to compile on any Unix-like platform that
 can run KDE.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="1_2">1.2 This Guide's<I> Raison d'&ecirc;tre</I></A>
</H2>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-style: normal">My goal in writing this guide
 is to help you explore Rosegarden, and to discover ways to use its
 features to solve real problems that you might encounter when creating
 your own music. Rosegarden is easy to use, once you come to understand
 its framework, but it's not quite like anything you are likely to have
 used in the past. As such, I wish to take you on a guided tour through
 Rosegarden, to demonstrate its capabilities, and to offer you a
 foundation from which your own creative projects can spring.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">My intention here is not to write an exhaustive
 technical manual that covers every single possibility in dry detail.
 This is a meandering journey through Rosegarden, taking you through
 real-world projects, and showing you things of interest along the way.
 I hope that by sharing my experiences and explaining how I've used
 Rosegarden to accomplish various and specific goals, we'll both be able
 to get more out of time spent with this application, for I am a student
 like you.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="1_3">1.3 Requirements</A></H2>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">I assume that you have a recent version of Rosegarden 4,
 and that it's working properly. I leave it to you to surf to the<A HREF="http://www.all-day-breakfast.com/rosegarden/download.html">
 Rosegarden download</A> page and work outward from there if you don't
 already have a copy. Several distros already have a rosegarden4 or
 rosegarden-4 package available through mainstream or third-party
 channels, and if it isn't already, yours will probably be among them
 soon.</P>
<P><I>NOTE: Rosegarden is under constant development. As such, some
 details or screenshots described here may not exactly match the
 software in front of you. I intend to keep this guide useful, but I
 don't have the energy to re-write it and create new images from the top
 down every time someone adds a new icon somewhere.</I></P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="1_4">1.4 How I Use Rosegarden</A></H2>
<P>The demonstration projects featured in this guide are all based on
 problems that I have solved for myself in the time since I began using
 Rosegarden. If I haven't done it, I can't write about it, and so it
 behooves you to see where I have gone, to decide whether my way of
 using this package bears any relevance to what you want to do with the
 software yourself.</P>
<P>I use Rosegarden for a variety of musical purposes. Among them, I use
 it to compose and arrange music, to generate notation that I can play
 on real instruments, for sequencing MIDI and audio accompaniment to use
 when playing live, and to put recordings of myself playing various
 parts on a number of instruments together.</P>
<P>One might say that Rosegarden is my band in a box. I have precious
 little contact with musical people, and so I make heavy use of my
 computer as an accompanist in a variety of ways. I find that it is much
 more rewarding to play music with other people, even if those other
 people are actually me, or a synthesizer. When I'm not accompanying
 myself with other live instruments, I can take advantage of the vast
 array of MIDI files available on the internet as and endless source of
 material for fun projects. (Believe me, there's no other way I would
 ever get to take a lead role in a Bach concerto, even if I were
 surrounded by musicians. :)</P>
<P>I live in a small town with a poor selection of music available at
 higher than list prices. Rosegarden gives me the flexibility to play
 anything I want at a cost measured in hours instead of dollars. I can
 adapt literature written for one instrument to another instrument of my
 choosing, taking into account any need to change the range or to adapt
 the part so that it can easily be played on transposing instruments. On
 those occasions when I do part with cash for a nicely formatted
 arrangement (I heartily recommend<A HREF="http://www.virtualsheetmusic.com/">
 http://www.virtualsheetmusic.com/)</A>, I can still use Rosegarden to
 drive my synthesizers to arrange and play the parts for instruments
 that I don't own, or parts that are just too difficult for me to
 attempt. If a piece requires an unreachable or particularly nasty note,
 I can transpose the entire thing, accompaniment and all. The
 flexibility that Rosegarden affords me brings me enormous musical joy.</P>
<P>I involve a wide variety of source materials in these projects, but
 for the purpose of this guide, I will stick with completely original
 compositions, so as to avoid any potential copyright issues. They may
 not be<I> good</I> compositions, but I own the rights to them, and can
 mangle them any way I choose without fear of any consequence more dire
 than rotten food being thrown at my head.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="1_5">1.5 The Author's Studio</A></H2>
<P>Obviously, I can only show you what I can do myself, and that is
 hardware dependant. I'd like you to bear in mind what is sitting in
 front of me as I write this, and thus I will share the details of my
 studio.</P>
<P>I'm running a 1.0 GHz Athlon system with 256 MB of RAM. The box runs
 Debian Woody with aftermarket KDE 3.0.3 from a third-party apt-source,
 and a variety of other add-ons that I've had to compile for myself
 along the way in order to get my build environment in line for bleeding
 edge software such as Rosegarden. I'm running a completely stock kernel
 2.4.19 that has had no patches applied. (I probably should look at
 latency tuning, but I am leery, and have thus far avoided it. I enjoy
 stabilty, and am not keen on giving applications the authority to
 trample all over my kernel.)</P>
<P>On the audio side of things, my sole soundcard is a Sound Blaster PCI
 128, driven by ALSA 0.9.0rc6 and Jack from CVS, with Woody's supplied
 LADSPA SDK and plugins.</P>
<P>On the MIDI side of things, I have a joystick port MIDI box for the
 Sound Blaster, to which I attach a Fatar MIDI-72 controller keyboard
 and a Roland SC-33 Sound Canvas. All of the source MIDI files that I
 work with in this guide were sequenced to make use of this particular
 GS synth, and as such, some of what I say in that area will not apply
 or even make sense to you if you're using an XG or other type of synth
 to follow along.</P>
<P>In addition to the Roland, I'm running an IWU Soft Synth via
 iiwusynth 0.2.2. Details of getting these working successfully are
 covered in the<A HREF="http://faq.html/"> FAQ.</A> I have it compiled
 against Jack, but have not yet managed to actually get the two to
 co-exist, so I run one or the other, depending on what I want to do
 with Rosegarden.</P>
<P>I run Rosegarden from CVS, which I compile frequently. As of this
 writing, the latest stable version is Rosegarden-4 0.8.5.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT SIZE="2"><I>TIP: You might want to consider
 running Rosegarden from a command line so you can see what's going on
 behind the GUI. What's gibberish to you may be a great help to the
 developers if there are problems, and it's sometimes reassuring to
 watch it working behind the scenes when it's too busy processing a
 particularly large bit of data to bother repainting its window.</I></FONT>

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-style: normal">In order to share a common
 frame of reference, let's turn on anything that isn't already displayed
 by default.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">Use the<B>

 toggled on the<B> Chord Name Ruler</B> when I took this snapshot. Also
 note that this is, unsurprisingly, where a number of Rosegarden

 audio. Segments can be cut, pasted, split, re-combined, overlapped and
 pretty much rearranged at will, and are very flexible.</P>

 you're probably wondering when we're going to do something useful, so

<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="2_4">2.4 The Studio</A></H2>
<P>Before importing anything into Rosegarden, we're going to want to set
 up instrument definitions for all of our MIDI devices so that nothing
 gets lost in the translation.</P>
<P>The<B> Studio</B> is where this is done. The mechanism for doing so
 works, but as of this writing it's a bit difficult to understand.
 There's some kind of mysterious Dummy MIDI Device in use that solves
 some kind of internal problem the developers were having, but it's not
 terribly intuitive. Hopefully this will change soon.</P>
<P>In the meantime, let's use what we've got. To set up instrument
 names, we want<B> Studio -&gt; Manage Midi Devices...</B></P>

 but trial and error will get you there. Roland GS uses the<B> MSB</B>
 for everything. Individual groups of names can only be assigned to a
 single<B> LSB/MSB</B> combination, so some of the groupings in this GS
 bank aren't as logical as they could be. I came up with the most
 logical names I could think of when naming the individual banks in this
 definition. Each group of names is associated with a GS bank number
 from the implementation chart, so I went down the list to find all the
 variations using a value of 32, and put them into Fourth Variations,
 etc. There's some overlap of things that aren't really grouped
 logically, (eg. melodic instruments in bank FX 1, but it's what we've
 got to work with, and this is the best way I could figure out to use
 it.</P>

SRC="using-rosegarden_html_m6856f77a.png" WIDTH="256"></FONT></A></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Now that we've imported the file, let's see how it
 fared. Rosegarden is not purely a MIDI sequencer, and a certain amount
 of translation takes place when importing MIDI files into Rosegarden's
 internal format. Sometimes this introduces minor problems that need to
 be corrected, which we will address directly.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="3_2">3.2 Transport Tools</A></H2>
<P>First, we need to see what it sounds like. Let's get to know the<B>
 Transport</B> window, and the<B> Playback Pointer</B>,<B></B> which are
 two of the tools we'll use to get around in our compositions.</P>
<P>Notice that there's a vertical blue bar in the<B> Segment Pane</B> of
 the main window. That is the<B> Playback Pointer</B>. You can move it
 to any arbitrary point in the composition by clicking on the<B> Ruler</B>
 at the top, or you can use the<B> Transport</B> to move it around. If
 you don't see it, play with the<B> Transport</B> or the<B> Ruler</B>
 until you move it out of hiding.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="198" NAME="Graphic31"
SRC="playback-pointer.png" WIDTH="104"></P>
<P>You'll initially have a separate, floating<B> Transport</B> window
 like this one.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" ALT="Transport Window" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="161"
NAME="Graphic2" SRC="using-rosegarden_html_m41d8a9c.png" WIDTH="428"></P>
<P>Most of these should be self-explanatory. If you can't figure out
 what any of the buttons do, hover over them a bit, and
 context-sensitive help will pop up. Of special note are the<B> Panic</B>
,<B> Metronome</B>,<B></B> and<B> Solo</B> buttons. If they're missing,
 toggle the flap via the <IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="26" NAME="Graphic48"

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><I><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="52" NAME="Graphic15"
SRC="using-rosegarden_html_m43e4dfc0.png" WIDTH="135"></I></P>
<P>The<B> Panic</B> button transmits an all notes off message. Use it,
 for example, when your synth has gotten a note stuck and the incessant
 droning of that low F# is driving you up the wall.</P>
<P>The<B> Metronome</B> does what you'd probably expect. You can turn
 the metronome on during normal playback, as well as recording, and it
 is a useful tool to use when practicing playing along with your
 composition.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">The<B> Solo</B> button mutes all tracks
 except for the one that's currently selected, allowing you a convenient
 way to hear just one part. (To solo more than one part, at present,
 you'll need to set the mute for tracks individually. The<B> Solo</B>
 button only affects a single track.)</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="3_3">3.3 Tweaking the Import</A></H2>
<P>Find the<B> Play/Pause</B> button and give this composition a listen.
 It's very likely that it will sound somewhat lame initially. That's the
 result of a few issues that Rosegarden needs a bit of help to work
 around.</P>
<P>This file was created with Cakewalk, and it includes a SysEx bank
 that would have set up the reverb level and various other paremeters on
 my synth. That has been lost. It includes percussion on two separate
 channels, which is why you're hearing those raunchy piano notes in the
 bass (that track was assigned to channel 9), and it's supposed to use
 the OrcheSet drum kit on my synth. The program change on channel 10 was
 lost.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">So, before you write me off as a terrible composer,
 let's get this back to the condition it was in when it left Cakewalk
 last year. We need to correct for what has been lost in the translation
 from raw MIDI to Rosegarden's internal format, and then we'll play with
 it.</P>
<P>The first thing we really need to do is fix the percussion. The most
 direct way to accomplish this is to assign the Conga track to the same
 device and channel as the previous track.</P>
<P>Click on the Conga track name, and hold the button down for a moment.
 Navigate through the various available devices until you find channel
 10. Your results will vary depending on a number of variables, but
 here's what it looks like here:<I> (Note that the Dummy MIDI Device
 will be changing to something more useful soon.)</I></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG BORDER="0" HEIGHT="319" NAME="Graphic49" SRC="fix-conga.png"
WIDTH="450"></P>
<P>Now, we really need to change the drum kit. At this time, Rosegarden
 can't yet cope with having GS-style named drumkits on channel 10. It's
 on the table, but no decision has yet been made as to exactly how best
 to implement it. Until then, we'll have to live with having an
 instrument listed instead of our drumkit.</P>
<P>I jumped the gun in taking the above snapshot. Note that I have
 already assigned the Strings program to this channel. It so happens
 that Strings corresponds to the correct program number I need to use in
 order to switch my Sound Canvas to the OrcheSet drumkit.</P>
<P>In order for you to do the same at home, click on either the Conga or
 the Orchestral bass, crash &amp; snare track name to select it. (Remember
 that they're both bound to the same device and channel, so a change
 made to one will affect the other.) Now click on the<B> Program</B>
 button in the<B> Instrument Parameters</B> pane.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="249" NAME="Graphic50"
SRC="using-rosegarden_html_m21c39b4a.png" WIDTH="175"></P>
<P>If the<B> Program</B> checkbox isn't checked, check it. Now you can
 scroll through with your mouse wheel, or select a name from the
 drop-down list. It's helpful if your synth has a display so that you
 can see when you happen to get to the correct program number. In this
 case, Strings in the Capital Tones bank is what we're after.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" ALT="dropdown list" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="202"
NAME="Graphic5" SRC="dropdown.png" WIDTH="100"></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">Of course your mileage with all of this
 will surely vary depending on your synth. You may not have the option
 of changing this at all, or may need to use a completely different
 method for changing it. XG users, I've learned, will need to use bank,
 rather than program changes, to change drum kits. Soft synth users and
 others who can make use of them will probably want to load an
 appropriate soundfont. Something medievalish would be tasty. Season to
 to suit yourself.</P>
<P>Now that the drums are a little more interesting, it's starting to
 sound better, but there's still work to do. We need to make up for that
 lost SysEx bank by cranking up the reverb.</P>
<H2 ALIGN="LEFT" CLASS="western" STYLE="font-style: normal"><A NAME="3_4">
3.4 Instrument Parameters</A></H2>
<P>The SysEx bank that Cakewalk included with this file has been lost in
 the translation. Luckily, Rosegarden makes it easy to set the initial
 values for the most common controllers right there in the<B> Instrument
 Parameters</B> pane. If you didn't notice this before, take note of the
 knobs in this pane.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><I><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="285" NAME="Graphic6"
SRC="using-rosegarden_html_m2b0e6d92.png" WIDTH="351"></I></P>
<P>Let's select each track in turn, and dial up the 'verb. Click on the<B>
 Reverb</B> knob and either use your mouse wheel or else drag the cursor
 in a straight horizontal or vertical line (don't try to drag it around
 in a circle) to change the position of the knob. Crank it up. You can
 never have too much reverb. Now lather, rinse, repeat until every track
 has major 'verbage. (Or reverbificate to taste, if you insist on having
 less than maximal 'verbage...)</P>
<P>Depending on your synth's implementation, some of these knobs may not
 actually be useful to you. If any of these knobs don't seem to have any
 effect, blame it on your synth.</P>
<P>Now is a good time to save. Remember to<B> <U>save early, save often</U>
</B>. Rosegarden is still under heavy development, and it's not fun to
 see your work evaporate. If you do discover a bug, try to determine a
 way to repeat it consistently, and let the Rosegarden team know about
 it.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="3_5">3.5 More About Segments</A></H2>
<P>You've seen what segments can do, but there are a few things that I
 couldn't demonstrate while the segments were empty.</P>
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT" CLASS="western"><A NAME="3_5_1">3.5.1 Segment Previews</A>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Look closely, and you'll notice that each one of the
 segments contains a miniature matrix or piano roll view. You can get
 some sense of what that bit of music is like just by looking at the
 segment display, which is a useful visual aid when dragging things
 around. If this feature is not turned on, turn it on with<B> Settings
 -&gt; Segment Previews</B>. Later, we'll see that we can also manipulate
 audio segments in similar fashion.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER" STYLE="font-style: normal"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" ALT="enlarged view of segments"
BORDER="0" HEIGHT="283" NAME="Graphic8" SRC="using-rosegarden_html_m48751921.png"
WIDTH="501"></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-style: normal">Now, let's overlap the
 segments. Select the Conga segment, and drag it up to the Orchestral
 bass, crash &amp; snare track.</P>
<P>Your screen should now resemble this:</P>

</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">For now, we'll leave the Conga track in place. The
 layering we've done gets both of these tracks into the same MIDI
 channel with aplomb, but we may need to drag the big track back out so
 that we can more readily get to the smaller ones beneath. I don't see a
 way to select a segment that's buried entirely beneath another segment.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Now that the drum kit has been corrected and both drum
 parts are playing on the correct channel, it's starting to shape up.</P>
<H1 CLASS="western"><A NAME="4">4 Let's Edit Some Notation</A></H1>
<P>For the next phase in our sample project, we want to look at what is
 necessary to make the flute part in this composition playable on a real
 flute, and then print a score. In this chapter, we'll make some basic
 changes to the part and work on cleaning up the humanized performance
 data so that it renders as more tidy notes. Later on, in Chapter 5,
 we'll add some new material to this part to make it more exciting to

<H2 ALIGN="LEFT" CLASS="western"><A NAME="4_1">4.1 Opening the Notation

 As you'd expect, this is where you go to view and edit your data as
 standard notation. This editor has many more features than I will make
 use of for my purposes here, but this should be enough of an
 introduction for you to get wherever you want to be with your own
 projects.</P>
<P>The first thing you'll notice is that there are different toolbars
 here. Before looking, let's synchronize our displays. You may not yet

<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Now that we're down to a reasonable
 register, let's do something about the ugly notes. The problem with
 human performance data is that it doesn't scale well into notation.
 You'll notice that some of the notes are displaying in yellow. That's
 because they're notes whose timing and duration don't quite make sense
 to Rosegarden within the context of this measure, so it has colored
 them to let you know that the notes on the page are only an
 approximation of what will actually be played. To see a view of the
 data in a more pure format, use the<B> Matrix</B> or<B> Event List</B>
 editors, which we'll take a look at later on.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Since our objective here is to make the
 notation more readable, we might as well remain here and alter the data
 until it better fits into place within the context of notation. In this

 play with<B> Transform -&gt; Quantize</B> instead. Let's tell it to<B>
 Quantize: Event positions, and round durations to exact notes</B>.
 We'll leave the<B> Base duration unit</B> at 16<SUP>th</SUP>, and
 accept the default<B> Note rounding</B> values and see where that gets
 us:</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium">Let's see how those changes
 sound, and then we'll see about turning those 16<SUP>th</SUP> note/rest
 pairs into something a little easier to read...</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium">The quantized notes seem to
 have fallen into place along sane boundaries without having an undue
 impact on the rhythm or feel of the piece. Bearing that in mind, let's
 back up a step and see what would have happened if we had quantized on
 8<SUP>th</SUP> note boundaries. Hit<B> ctrl-Z</B> or use<B> Edit -&gt;
 Undo</B>, then run through the<B> Transformations -&gt; Quantize</B>
 dialog again, specifying a base duration of 8<SUP>th</SUP> note this
 time around.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium">Very nice indeed, and
 Rosegarden has rendered some 16<SUP>th</SUP> notes and other odd bits
 as required, ignoring the base duration when it really had to. That's
 one of the best jobs of quantization I've seen in a notation editor.
 There won't be much clean-up to do from here:</P>

 they're less awkward to count. Let's see about changing them.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium">There's an odd dotted 16<SUP>

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium">Now let's do two more things
 to enhance readability. I'm used to reading beamed groups that count
 out to one beat. Let's separate those two groups, and add another slur.
 Select the first two 8<SUP>th</SUP> notes in that four-note group, then
 use<B> Group -&gt; Beam Group</B> to fuse those two together. The
 remaining two notes adapt automatically, and remain beamed. Now select
 all four of the 8<SUP>th</SUP> notes plus the half note and add a slur.
 Finally, notice that the note stems are in the way of the slur. Let's
 select the second pair of 8<SUP>th</SUP> notes and use<B> Notes -&gt; Stem
 Direction -&gt; Stems Down</B> or else<B> ctrl-PageDown</B> to change
 their direction. You should wind up with a measure resembling this one:</P>
