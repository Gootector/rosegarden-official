 Introduction</A></H1>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="1_1">1.1 What is Rosegarden?</A></H2>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-style: normal">Rosegarden-4, hereafter
 referred to as simply Rosegarden, is a versatile application that seeks
 to be a useful tool for those wanting to create music. It combines
 aspects of a MIDI sequencer, an audio sequencer, and a notation editor
 into one convenient, easy to use package that provides users with a
 consistent and intuitive interface.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
<!--SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"-->
Rosegarden is a native KDE application that can run on
 any system that has the KDE and QT libraries installed, and currently
 requires a minimum of KDE/QT 3.0 in order to run. Many of its features
 may only work Linux systems, but it is designed to compile and run on
 any Unix-like platform capable of running KDE. (See the<A HREF="http://faq.html/">

<!--SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"-->
 FAQ</A>
<!--SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"-->
 for details on building for systems that can't run ALSA.)</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="1_2">1.2 This Guide's<I> Raison d'&ecirc;tre</I></A>
</H2>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-style: normal">My goal in writing this guide
 is to help you explore Rosegarden, and to discover ways to use its
 features to solve real problems that you might encounter when creating
 your own music. Rosegarden is easy to use, once you come to understand
 its framework, but it's not quite like anything you are likely to have
 used in the past. As such, I wish to take you on a guided tour through
 Rosegarden, to demonstrate many of its capabilities, and to offer you a
 foundation from which your own creative projects can spring.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="1_3">1.3 Requirements</A></H2>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">I assume that you have at least Rosegarden 4 version
 0.9.0, and that it's working properly. I leave it to you to surf to the
 Rosegarden download page at<A HREF="http://www.all-day-breakfast.com/download.html">
 http://www.all-day-breakfast.com/download.html</A> and work outward
 from there if you don't already have a copy. Several distros already
 have a rosegarden4 or rosegarden-4 package available through mainstream
 or third-party channels, and if it isn't already, yours will probably
 be among them soon.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="1_4">1.4 The Author's Studio</A></H2>
<P>Obviously, what I can actually demonstrate is hardware dependant. I'd
 like you to bear in mind what is sitting in front of me as I write
 this, and thus I will share the details of my &quot;studio.&quot;</P>
<P>I'm running a 1.0 GHz Athlon system with 256 MB of RAM. The box runs
 Debian Woody with backported KDE 3.1.1a and associated packages from
 third-party apt-sources. I'm running a completely stock kernel 2.4.19
 that has had no patches applied.</P>
<P>On the audio side of things, my sole soundcard is a Sound Blaster PCI
 128, driven by ALSA 0.9.0rc6 and Jack from CVS, with Woody's supplied
 LADSPA SDK and plugins.</P>
<P>On the MIDI side of things, I have a joystick port MIDI box for the
 Sound Blaster, to which I attach a Fatar MIDI-72 controller keyboard
 and a Roland SC-33 Sound Canvas.</P>
<P>In addition to the Roland, I'm running a couple of ALSA soft synths:
 Fluid Synth 1.0 and Harmony 0.7.5. Details of getting these working
 successfully are covered in the<A HREF="http://faq.html/"> FAQ.</A></P>

 Use the Settings menu to toggle these options. Note that
 this is, unsurprisingly, where a number of Rosegarden settings can be
 configured. We'll come back to some of those later on.</P>

TIP: If your Zoom Slider is cut off by a toolbar, try dragging it within
 your toolbar palette until it's the last item on the right. This is a
 known issue, but seems to be a greater QT/KDE problem, and there's not
 much the Rosegarden developers can do to avoid it. Luckily, it's very
 easy to remedy, and your toolbar settings will be remembered the next
 time you start Rosegarden.</I></P>
<P>Moving down into the window itself, you'll find the s

<P>Unless you begin with an imported MIDI file, it all starts with a
<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->

<!--SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"-->

 segment, which is a convenient container that stores a bit of note data
 or audio. Segments are somewhat similar to layers in an image editing
 program such as the GIMP. They can be cut, pasted, split, re-combined,
 overlapped and pretty much rearranged at will, and are very flexible.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">You can begin recording (audio or MIDI)
 to create one, or you can draw one from scratch.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Use the <IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="26"

 within the bar, but you can override that behavior by holding down the
 shift key while dragging.</P>

Highlighting the smaller of two overlapping segments can sometimes be a
 bit tricky, but once accomplished, you can use<B> Segments -&gt; Join</B>

 in an image editing program.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">This can
 also merge events from several different tracks into a single segment.
 The events will combine, and merge onto a segment on whichever track is
 currently active.</P>

<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->

<!--SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"-->
Now I'll need to demonstrate a few segments that
 actually contain events. Notice the miniature &quot;piano roll&quot; contained
 within each. You can get some sense of what that bit of music is like
 just by looking at the segment display, which is a useful visual aid
 when dragging things around. If this feature is not turned on, turn it

 Autosave</A></H2>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">I'll conclude this section by mentioning a
 very useful feature that doesn't quite fit in anywhere else. As always,
 &quot;save early, save often&quot; is the mantra of computer users everywhere,
 and can't be stressed enough. It's never a bad idea to take time out to
 save your work.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">However, Rosegarden attempts to save you
 from yourself.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-style: normal">If the GUI crashes for some
 reason, or you have a power outage or the like, the next time you start
 Rosegarden and attempt to load the file you were working on, you'll be
 presented with the option of loading the autosave file instead. If you
 hadn't yet saved the file, you'll find it in your ~/autosave directory
 with a basic name of &quot;untitled.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">The
 autosave interval defaults to 60 seconds. Configure it via the<B>
 Settings</B> menu.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">By now,
 you're probably wondering when we're going to do something useful, so
 let's go take a look at the studio. Before we continue, you'll want to
 dump anything you've just been piddling with and start with a fresh new
 document for reasons I'll explain shortly.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="2_5">2.5 The Studio</A></H2>
<P>Before importing anything into Rosegarden, we're going to want to set
 up instrument definitions for all of our MIDI devices. One quirk with
 Rosegarden is that If there is no
<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->
 instrument definition for a
 particular program/bank change, then that information will disappear
 when the data is imported, so configuring the studio is something best
 done early on. If, for example, you wish to import a document that has
 GS program changes, you'll need to configure your studio accordingly
 beforehand.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="2_5_1">2.5.1 No Global Instrument
 Definitions</A></H3>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Every native Rosegarden file contains a
 studio definition that describes your MIDI landsacpe. The idea is that
 once you have properly configured your studio it will be very easy to
 control all of your equipment without having to worry about the details
 of what is connected where. In practice, it works quite well, but it
 does present some special considerations that will probably seem
 somewhat strange to you if you cut your teeth on some other package
 before trying Rosegarden.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Every native Rosegarden composition (.rg)
 file contains a studio, along with note events and other types of data,
 and this studio definition remains with the file for its lifetime. If
 you create several files and then change some aspect of your MIDI
 landscape, you'll need to correct the studio component of every
 existing file, as there's currently no facility for making the default
 setup override the settings contained in these files.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="2_5_2">2.5.2 Configuring MIDI Connections</A>
</H3>
<P>The first step in configuring your studio is to set up connections to
 your MIDI devices via<B> Studio -&gt; Manage MIDI Devices...</B></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">You'll be presented with a dialog that
 resembles this one:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
HEIGHT="277" NAME="Graphic78" SRC="using-rosegarden_html_3535a1a7.png" WIDTH="605">
</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium">Rosegarden recognizes two
 types of MIDI ports. A device can be a Play Device or a Record Device.
 A duplex MIDI Port such as that found on my Sound Blaster, which
 provides both MIDI IN and MIDI OUT, is divided into two separate
 devices.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium">In the above example, you
 see that Device 1 is my external MIDI OUT device, Device 2 is MIDI IN,
 and I have an empty slot with no connection that I've reserved for use
 with Fluid Synth, which wasn't running when I took that snapshot.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium">Note that most of the items
 in this dialog box are read-only. You can change the connections
 around, but cannot rename anything from here. The names, such as
 &quot;Roland SC-33&quot; come from the instrument definitions which are attached
 to this particular device. We'll look at how to change those directly.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium">In the meantime, what you<I>
 can</I>
<!--SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"-->
 do from this dialog is re-arrange which device slots are
 connected to which hardware (or virtual hardware, in the case of a soft
 synth) paths, and you can create or delete devices at will. One use for
 that is to create a device for an ALSA soft synth that isn't currently
 running, so that you can assign programs to it in advance, and have
 everything ready to go at such time as you decide to start up that
 synth, and the path to that particular synth becomes available to
 Rosegarden.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><I>NOTE: These empty slots
 are given default connections in the order that new connections become
 available to Rosegarden. If you intend to have Fluid Synth on Device 3
 and Hydrogen on Device 4, and you wish to set up meaningful program
 changes for those synths in advance, you'll need to be sure to start
 those applications in the correct order, or else you'll have to come
 back to this dialog and switch the connections around whenever you've
 changed the order in which they are detected.</I></P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="2_5_3">2.5.3 Loading An Instrument
 Definition</A></H3>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Once you've configured your device
 connections, you'll probably want to load or create some instrument
 definitions. This is accomplished via<B> Studio -&gt; Manage MIDI Banks
 and Programs...</B></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">To load an instrument definition, you'll
 first want to select a destination device from among those available.
 In this example, I don't have the connection for the Fluid Synth
 configured, and I haven't changed the default name, so my external

 implementation is device-dependent. Rosegarden allows you only one
 definition for each a unique MSB/LSB address.</P>

 Definition</A></H3>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">If none of the bank definitions in the
 library fit, and you can't load the program names out of a soundfont,
 you can use an existing file from the library as a starting point, or
 you can create a new instrument definition completely from scratch.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Taking the example of my Roland SC-33, I
 looked at the implementation chart in the back of the manual, and then
 decided how I wanted to arrange the banks. Since the LSB/MSB address of
 the bank is what makes it unique, and they can actually all have
 identical names, I had to give some real thought to the best way to
 organize my available patches in order to make getting to what I wanted
 to find as simple and logical as possible.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">I tried to come up with names for the
 banks that roughly reflect what sort of variations are available in
 each one, though it's somewhat imperfect because Roland wasn't very
 orderly in deciding what to put where, and there are some few melodic
 instruments in banks that are normally only used for sound effects.
 Depending on your hardware, you, too, may face similar compromises.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Once you've decided what your instrument
 definition needs to contain, and how it should be organized, entering
 your data is a straightforward matter. Use the<B> Add Bank</B> and<B>

 the way, then start filling out the dialog box. If you have similar
 sets of program changes in two different banks, you can copy one from
 the other using<B> Copy Programs</B> and<B> Paste Programs</B> to save
 yourself some typing.</P>

<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">If you don't enter a string for a
 particular program number, you won't have to scroll through that slot

<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">The metronome does what you'd probably
 expect. You can turn the metronome on during normal playback, as well
 as recording, and it is a useful tool to use when practicing playing
 along with your composition.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">The solo button mutes all tracks except
 for the one that's currently selected, allowing you a convenient way to
 hear just one part. (To &quot;solo&quot; more than one part, at present, you'll

<P>Now that you understand how to use the transport, find the<B></B>

 play/pause<B></B> button and give this composition a listen. It's very
 likely that it will sound somewhat lame initially. That's the result of
 a few issues that Rosegarden needs a bit of help to work around.</P>
<P>This file was created with Cakewalk, and it includes a SysEx bank
 that would have set up the reverb level and various other paremeters on
 my synth. While Rosegarden does provide a facility for manipulating
 SysEx, it evidently doesn't know how to import Cakewalk-style SysEx
 dumps.</P>
<P>Another issue is the drum kit. It was supposed to have been
 &quot;OrcheSet,&quot; but the program change has gone into the bit bucket because
 Rosegarden doesn't currently recognize a need to handle program changes
 on channel 10.</P>
<P>So, let's get this back to the condition it was in when it left
 Cakewalk a few years ago. We need to correct for what has been lost in
 the translation from raw MIDI to Rosegarden's internal format, and then
 we'll play with it. Fortunately, these minor issues are simple to fix
 up.</P>

 drum kits on channel 10. It's on the table, but no decision has yet
 been made as to exactly how best to implement it. Until then, we'll
 have to live with having an instrument listed instead of our drum kit.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">It happens that &quot;OrcheSet&quot; has the same
 program number as &quot;Strings.&quot; We already have a track assigned to
 &quot;Strings,&quot; but it's on the wrong channel, so we can't simply scroll
 through the instrument/channel assignment menus to accomplish this.
 Instead, we need to have a look at the Instrument Parameters box of the
 main window.</P>

 Program checkbox isn't checked, check it. Now you can scroll
 through with your mouse wheel, or select a name from the drop-down
 list. It's helpful if your synth has a display so that you can see when
 you happen to get to the correct program number. That's how I arrived
 at the conclusion that &quot;Strings&quot; and &quot;OrcheSet&quot; have the same program
 number.</P>

<P>The SysEx bank that Cakewalk included with this file has been lost in

<P>Let's select each track in turn, and dial up the 'verb. Click on the
<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->

 Reverb knob and either use your mouse wheel or else drag the cursor in
 a straight horizontal or vertical line (don't try to drag it around in
 a circle) to change the position of the knob. Crank it up. You can
 never have too much reverb. Now lather, rinse, repeat until every track
 has major 'verbage. (Or reverbificate to taste, if you insist on having
 less than maximal 'verbage...)</P>
<P>Depending on your synth's implementation, some of these knobs may not
 actually be useful to you. If any of these knobs don't seem to have any
 effect, chalk it up to your implementation. (In truth, I have no idea
 what several of them are supposed to do, and I have a real hardware
 synthesizer.)</P>
<H1 CLASS="western"><A NAME="4">4 Editing Notation</A></H1>
<P>Rosegarden stores events in a format that's very notation friendly.
 Notation is such an integral part of the package that I like to think
 of the notation as the &quot;real&quot; data, though it is, of course, only one
 of the ways the data can be presented to you.</P>
<P>One especially unique, powerful and useful feature is the way
 Rosegarden stores two sets of timings for every event. When you import
 a MIDI file or record from a keyboard, the raw data gets run through
 the notation quantizer before being presented to you.</P>
<P>This allows you to maintain a copy of the score for printing, and a
 copy for playback, affording you the advantages of machine-precise
 scores while preserving the subtle nuances of human performance.</P>
<P>The feature is new, and not quite complete, however, and there are a
 few limitations on what you can and cannot do. Look for this to improve
 for 1.0, but it's rather useful in its present state.</P>

 be addressed by inserting multi-measure rests in the future, but we've
 come to no consensus on that issue as yet. In the meantime, I prefer to
 work with compositions that have long segments where periods of silence

<P>The

 Transport Toolbar that we turned on in the preceding section is
 the same as in every other window, with two notable exceptions, which
 is why I've saved it until now. These extra buttons are useful for
 controlling playback when the

 you're editing, and you want to hear what you're working on.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="27" NAME="Graphic54"
SRC="using-rosegarden_html_m4ed48e22.png" WIDTH="230"></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">If you haven't moved it, the
<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->
 playback pointer is at or
 near the beginning of the composition. This part doesn't come in until
 much later, so if we hit the Play button now, we can't expect to hear
 anything for awhile.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium">The notation editor has its
 own cursor, which is just like the one that sweeps across the segment
 canvas in the main window, except that this one is magenta. In order to
 control playback, you need to be able to manipulate both cursors, and
 those two extra buttons on the end of the toolbar help you do just
 that.</P>

<P>Those of you familiar with previous versions of Rosegarden will note
 the absence of the Smoothing slider and associated menu options. As I
 mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, Rosegarden now maintains
 two independent values for note duration, making it more easy than ever
 before to clean up notation, and allowing you to do so without altering
 the characteristics of the performance.</P>
<P>The Raw Note Ruler shows you the difference between the duration of
 the note on the staff and the actual timing of the performance data. It
 may eventually be possible to manipulate the performance duration
 directly from the ruler, though for the moment it mainly serves to show
 you how much the written notation differs from the raw timing.</P>
<H1 CLASS="western"><A NAME="5">5 Incomplete....</A></H1>
<P>Sorry folks, I'm just out of time, and out of gumption to work on

<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="5_2">5.2 De-Humanizing</A></H2>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Now that we're down to a reasonable
 register, let's do something about the ugly notes. The problem with
 human performance data is that it doesn't scale well into notation.
 You'll notice that some of the notes are displaying in yellow. That's
 because they're notes whose timing and duration don't quite make sense
 to Rosegarden within the context of this measure, so it has colored
 them to let you know that the notes on the page are only an
 approximation of what will actually be played. To see a view of the
 data in a more pure format, use the<B> Matrix</B> or<B> Event List</B>
 editors, which we'll take a look at later on.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Since our objective here is to make the
 notation more readable, we might as well remain here and alter the data
 until it better fits into place within the context of notation. In this
 instance, readability is more important to us than the faithful
 rendering of a human performance, so we're going to end up making
 &quot;physical&quot; changes to the data along the way.</P>
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT" CLASS="western"><A NAME="5_2_1">5.2.1 Quantize</A></H3>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">I think this data is so messy that we're
 going to have to quantize it. Let's<B> Undo</B> that last change, and
 play with<B> Transform -&gt; Quantize</B> instead. Let's tell it to<B>
 Quantize: Event positions, and round durations to exact notes</B>.
 We'll leave the<B> Base duration unit</B> at 16<SUP>th</SUP>, and

 us:</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium">Let's see how those changes
 sound, and then we'll see about turning those 16<SUP>th</SUP> note/rest
 pairs into something a little easier to read...</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium">The quantized notes seem to
 have fallen into place along sane boundaries without having an undue
 impact on the rhythm or feel of the piece. Bearing that in mind, let's
 back up a step and see what would have happened if we had quantized on
 8<SUP>th</SUP> note boundaries. Hit<B> ctrl-Z</B> or use<B> Edit -&gt;
 Undo</B>, then run through the<B> Transformations -&gt; Quantize</B>
 dialog again, specifying a base duration of 8<SUP>th</SUP> note this
 time around.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium">Very nice indeed, and
 Rosegarden has rendered some 16<SUP>th</SUP> notes and other odd bits
 as required, ignoring the base duration when it really had to. That's
 one of the best jobs of quantization I've seen in a notation editor.

<P>The current design plan calls for a rudimentary print facility
 incorporated within Rosegarden itself, whose purpose is to allow rough
 draft printing, combined with off-loading the task onto an external
 utility for high quality printing. The print engine in CVS works pretty
 well for draft printing. The print engine in 0.9.0 is totally horrible.
 If you want to print notation, dump 0.9.0 and get CVS.</P>
<P>The &quot;external utility&quot; of choice is Lilypond, and we've put a lot of
 effort into making Rosegarden a useful front end for Lilypond. We also
 support music XML, but the active development is on Lilypond export.</P>

<P>I've spent many hours on the Lilypond export code myself, trying to
 make it work as well as possible. I've added a lot to what Hans
 originally provided, and there have been many improvements. Notably,
 I've taken advantage of Rosegarden's new &quot;metadata&quot; facility to provide
 mechanism for exporting user-specified headers.
<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->
 I'm very grateful to
 Chris and Guillaume for providing some way for me to be able to export
 these, and for you to enter them. This really deserves a proper
 explanation, complete with visuals, but I don't have time to do it
 right. For now, a brief description:</P>
<P>Look at<B> Edit -&gt; Edit Document Properties</B>
<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->
, then look at the<B>
 Description</B>
<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->
 tab. Put the header name (eg. &quot;title&quot;) in the<B> Name</B>
<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->

 field, and the string you want attached to that header in the<B> Value</B>
<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->

 field. All 14 possible headers are exported now, but the interface is
 still a bit weird.</P>
<P>In spite of all this effort, however, Lilypond export is an imperfect
 thing. Rosegarden and Lilypond have different ideas about how to draw
 some things, and there's no getting around the need to manually tweak
 your Lilypond files for the best possible results, or at least to feed
 the export a set of things that it can translate well.</P>
<P>With careful planning, good results are possible, but if you attach
 five marks to every note and have all sorts of performance directions
 and whatnot in the same space, Lilypond will jumble it up. There just
 isn't any reasonable mechanism for getting Lilypond to render things as
 far above or below the staff as Rosegarden does, and there's only so
 much an export filter can do.</P>
<P>If there's something you don't like about the Lilypond export, please
 let me know. Hans is still the official &quot;owner&quot; of the code, but I'm
 currently the one actively working on it. There are still some bugs and
 missing features, and I'm eager to get user feedback; particularly to
 hear whether you like the way I've implemented the new features, and
 what you'd like done differently. I want to make this as useful to you
 as it can be, and I have both the time and willingness to devote a lot
 of effort to incremental improvements.</P>

<H1 CLASS="western"><A NAME="6">6 Using Audio</A></H1>
<P>Those of you with a keen interest in matters audio have probably been
 wondering why it took me so long to get to this. The truth is, I've
 just never gotten around to trying to do anything serious in this area,
 and I haven't really done much with these features. As I said in the
 introduction, I am not an audio guy.</P>
<P>At present, I can't offer the same level of detail as in the rest of
 this guide, because what I say here is not based on real experience.
 Still, there is great demand for information on this subject, so I will
 do what I can to show you how to make use of the features.<I> (If I'm
 leaving something important out, or my explanation is really off, feel
 free to let me know.)</I></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">We'll start by loading the composition we
 worked on in Project 1, then add some audio to it and look at how to
 manipulate it.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="6_1">6.1 Configuring an Audio Editor</A></H2>
<P>Rosegarden has no built-in facility for editing audio. Instead, it
 provides a mechanism for you to configure an external editor, via<B>
 Settings -&gt; Configure Rosegarden</B>

 on the<B> External Editors</B>

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium">You can browse to your
 editor of choice via the<B> Choose...</B> button, or type the name of
 the executable. My personal preference is for Audacity (<A HREF="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">

), which I really like, but there
 are many suitable editors available.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="6_2">6.2 Importing Existing Audio</A></H2>
<P>There are two ways to get audio into Rosegarden. If you wish to
 import projects that you have been working on with some other
 application, you can import the audio files and insert them into your
 composition. The heart of this facility is the

 menu, tucked away at the bottom, below the
 divider:</P>

<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">This takes you to the dialog you use to
 select audio files for insertion into your compositions:</P>

HEIGHT="275" NAME="Graphic61" SRC="using-rosegarden_html_m4e2b1e73.png" WIDTH="742">
</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium">Using this is fairly
 straightforward. Use the<B> Add Audio File</B> button to pick a file,
 which will then appear in the list. I'll just grab some .wav files that
 I have handy, since I haven't actually recorded anything related to
 this composition:</P>

</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium">Once the files are loaded,
 some statistics are printed, and a brief preview appears. You can us
 the<B> Play Preview</B> button to hear what you've got.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE="2"><I>NOTE: If
 the<B> Play Preview</B> button is grayed out, as in the above example,
 it probably means that either Rosegarden wasn't compiled with audio
 features enabled, or else your audio server is not running. In my case,
 I forgot to run Jack before starting Rosegarden.</I></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium">Once you're satisfied that
 you've selected the correct files, you can insert them into your
 composition one by one with the<B> Insert into Composition</B> button.
 Let's insert &quot;rouen.wav&quot; and make both Dave Barry and Guillaume Laurent
 proud:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
HEIGHT="61" NAME="Graphic75" SRC="using-rosegarden_html_12ab5630.png" WIDTH="397">
</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium">Newly-inserted audio
 segments go into a new track of their own, and it's always appended to
 the bottom of the<B> Tracklist</B>.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE="2"><I>TIP: If
 you're working on a newly-created composition, rather than one that is
 based on a MIDI import, it will start with a large number of tracks. It
 may appear that nothing happened after you hit the<B> Insert into
 Composition...</B> button. Scroll down to the bottom, and you should
 see a new track with your audio segment inserted.</I></FONT></P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><A NAME="6_3">6.3
 Recording</A></H2>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">It is possible to record directly into
 Rosegarden. First you'll want to point the track to a Jack source in
 the same fashion used to assign tracks to MIDI devices.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
HEIGHT="378" NAME="Graphic76" SRC="using-rosegarden_html_m1bb3bee5.png" WIDTH="371">
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE="2"><I>NOTE: I honestly have
 no idea what JACK Audio #0 through #15 mean.</I></FONT></P>
<P>Now if the <IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="16" NAME="Graphic77"
SRC="record-button.png" WIDTH="15"> button is toggled for the track,
 making it the destination for record operations, any signal on the
 mixer channel you've selected as the record source (via KMix or the
 like) should be recorded, and should wind up in an audio segment.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2"><I>NOTE: The one time I tried that, it didn't work
 very well, and I haven't tried to do it since. I'm not sure whether or
 not this is actually supposed to work. I need to play with that, but at
 this writing I am quickly running out of time, and want to get this out
 the door. I don't currently have Jack working, and don't have time to
 figure out why it's broken.</I></FONT></P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="6_4">6.4 Manipulating Audio Segments</A></H2>
<P><I>Audio segments behave in the same fashion as segments containing
 notation data. You can drag them around, drag them from track to track,
 and so on. You can split them, move bits of them around. I don't have
 time to show you any of that at this writing. I need to go to work, and
 I want to get this published before I go.</I></P>
<P><I>I plan to:</I></P>
<P><I> check on recording</I></P>
<P><I> find out what jack #0  15 mean</I></P>
<P><I> explain how to use Edit Audio and Auto-Split Audio</I></P>
<P><I> do a real project with a mixture of MIDI and audio</I></P>
<P><I> demonstrate the use of LADSPA plugins</I></P>
<P><I> ???</I></P>
<H1 CLASS="western"><A NAME="7">7 That's All, Folks...</A></H1>
<P>That's all I've had time to do to date. There are many more topics I
 wish to treat eventually, but there are so many developments in the
 works at the time of this writing that I'm just as well off to hold
 back, to reduce the amount of material I will have to adapt to suit
 changing future realities. I've already written about far too many
 features that are only available in CVS as it is.</P>
<P>I hope what you've seen has given you ideas for projects that<B> you</B>
<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->

 can do with Rosegarden. If I've left something that's very important to
 you out, please feel free to send me a note at<A HREF="mailto:dmmcintyr@users.sourceforge.net">

 need and discuss it sooner.</P>
