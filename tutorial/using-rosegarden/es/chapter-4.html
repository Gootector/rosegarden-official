<H1><A NAME="3">3 The Studio</A></H1>
<P>Now that you have a general idea how Rosegarden works, now is a good
 time to think about telling Rosegarden something about the MIDI
 equipment you wish to use. People who intend to use Rosegarden purely
 for audio work are free to skip this chapter entirely.</P>
<P>Before we get started, some of you might need some basic background
 information so that you can dive into this with some understanding of
 the concepts I am about to explain. If you are new to MIDI, or if
 anything in this chapter leaves you scratching your head, you might
 want to read through my MIDI Primer in Appendix A.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="3_1">3.1 What is a Studio?</A></H2>
<P>Every native Rosegarden composition (<B>.rg</B>) file contains a
 studio definition in addition to all the nuts and bolts stuff of music.
 The studio is a definition of every MIDI device Rosegarden can detect
 during the course of editing the composition. (Everything that was
 there at the start, plus any new devices that become available during
 the course of editing; as when starting something like ZynAddSubFX in
 the middle of working on a composition, for example.) It comprises
 information about the device itself, and about how data is routed into
 or out of it.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="3_1_1">3.1.1 What is a Connection?</A></H3>
<P>Rosegarden has an integrated MIDI router to manage the flow of raw
 MIDI events into and out of ports provided by the underlying ALSA
 infrastructure. You can think of this as something like the sort of
 router often used to share a broadband internet connection. Unlike
 ethernet, however, MIDI is not bidirectional over the same cable. As a
 consequence of this, all connections in Rosegarden are unidrectional;
 even if both connections belong to the same physical piece of hardware.
 Connections will be displayed as one of &quot;read,&quot; &quot;write,&quot; or &quot;duplex.&quot;
 In this diagram, connections are represented by black arrows that point
 in the direction data will flow through them. Rosegarden's MIDI router
 allows you to rearrange these connections as you require, to change
 what is connected where.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic14"
SRC="../pixmaps/studio-diagram-midi-router.jpg" ></P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="3_1_2">3.1.2 What is a Device?</A></H3>
<P>A device is a sort of virtual model of an individual piece of MIDI
 equipment. Equipment, in this sense, can be full-fledged external MIDI
 hardware, internal hardware like the Sound Blaster Live!, or virtual
 hardware like QSynth or VKeybd. Each device encapsulates information
 about the capabilities of a piece of equipment, and allows you to make
 use of those capabilities from within Rosegarden. In effect, the better
 the job you do of describing a particular device in Rosegarden, the
 better control you will have over that device.</P>
<P>For example, if you have a nice keyboard attached to your computer,
 but you accept Rosegarden's default General MIDI device definition for
 it, you will be unable to make use of any of the keyboard's advanced
 features from within Rosegarden until you make your device definition
 more accurate. Conversely, telling Rosegarden you have a Roland JV-88
 does not make it so, and if you assign any<B> instruments</B> to
 programs that are not actually available on the connected equipment,
 you will hear no sound. (More about instruments in the next chapter.)</P>
<P>A device like the following is typical of either QSynth or a Sound
 Blaster Live! after loading an uncomplicated soundfont. It includes a
 basic set of controllers (which are dependent on the capabilities of
 either QSynth or the Sound Blaster, both of which do support a limited
 number of controllers, and actually have nothing to do with the
 soundfont per se), a set of standard General MIDI programs loaded into
 bank 0 0, and a set of Roland GS-style extra drum kits loaded into bank
 1 0.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic15"
SRC="../pixmaps/studio-diagram-play-device.jpg" ></P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="3_1_3">3.1.3 Putting Connections and
 Devices Together</A></H3>
<P>A studio can consist of just one device, and perhaps for many of you
 that is all the complexity you will ever need. The real power, however,
 lies with Rosegarden's ability to manage numerous devices
 simultaneously. A studio is, in effect, a collection of device
 descriptions and a routing table ensuring that the right devices are
 connected to the right MIDI equipment on the other end.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western"><A NAME="3_1_3_1">3.1.3.1 A Simple Sound Blaster
 Live! Studio</A></H4>
<P>Even on the comparatively simple and very inexpensive end of the
 hardware spectrum, it is quite possible to have more than one device to
 manage. The Sound Blaster Live! falls into this category, with four
 separate write connections available, and four separate play devices.
 (Actually, there are five write connections once you include the duplex
 external MIDI port, but that is not depicted here.) They all share the
 same soundfont on the hardware side, but Rosegarden doesn't know that
 until you configure the studio that way, by loading programs out of the
 soundfont into each of the four play devices. (More on that last point
 in a moment.)</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic13"
SRC="../pixmaps/studio-diagram-sb-live.jpg" ></P>
<H4 CLASS="western"><A NAME="3_1_3_2">3.1.3.2 A Typical QSynth Studio</A>
</H4>
<P>Another typical, simple setup involves using QSynth for MIDI playback
 and VKeybd for input. You can start either of these after starting
 Rosegarden, and Rosegarden will detect them and make a play connection
 and a record connection available, along with an empty play device.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic12"
SRC="../pixmaps/studio-diagram-simple.jpg" ></P>
<H4 CLASS="western"><A NAME="3_1_3_3">3.1.3.3 A More Complex Studio</A></H4>
<P>This is what my own studio looks like when I have QSynth, Hydrogen,
 and ZynAddSubFX running, along with my Roland Sound Canvas and my Sound
 Blaster Live!. It looks horribly complex on paper, and it would look
 even worse if I drew out every single bank of GS variations, and did a
 better job of representing the fact that, while the same soundfont
 happens to be loaded into both the Sound Blaster and QSynth, that
 doesn't<I> have</I> to be the case. No matter how it looks, this is
 actually quite simple to use day to day, believe it or not. Rosegarden
 makes this easy.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">Notice that I have controllers for the
 Sound Blaster, for QSynth, and for the Roland (the &quot;External MIDI GS
 Synth&quot;), but I do not have any controllers defined for Hydrogen or
 ZynAddSubFX. That's because, to the best of my knowledge, neither of
 those soft synths knows how to do anything with controllers. They both
 have their own control panels that must be twiddled manually, and that
 sort of thing can't be automated from within Rosegarden.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic11"

<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="3_2">3.2 Enough Theory Already! How Do I
 Configure MY
<!--SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"-->
 Studio?</A></H2>
<P>I'm glad you asked. The first step in this process is to open the
 main Studio dialog.<B> Composition -&gt; Studio -&gt; Manage MIDI Devices...</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
 or by clicking on the <IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic5"
SRC="../pixmaps/studio-icon.png" > icon.</P>
<P>You'll be presented with a dialog that resembles this one, except, of
 course, that this one has already largely been configured to suit my
 own default studio. It is divided into two sections; one for play
 devices, and one for record devices, and their associated connections.
 It also shows you how each of these devices is connected to internal,
 external, and software synths. In this example, I have a device named
 &quot;Roland SC-33&quot; connected to &quot;64:0 EMU101K MPU-401 (UART) (duplex)&quot; and
 four &quot;SB Live (?)&quot; devices connected to each of 65:0 through 65:3,
 which are the four output ports on my SB Live!, with their associated
 write connections. I also have three generic spots reserved for soft
 synths, named &quot;Soft Synth 1&quot; through &quot;Soft Synth 3&quot;, one of which is
 currently connected to KAMix, an ALSA mixer client that can be
 controlled via MIDI. These are empty devices that I created with the<B>
 New</B> button.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
 <IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic1" SRC="../pixmaps/manage-devices-dialog.png"
></P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="3_2_1">3.2.1 Connections</A></H3>
<P>The reality of Rosegarden's MIDI router is a bit less intuitive than
 the diagram I presented earlier. Here is that same diagram with the
 ALSA port numbers included.</P>
<P><I>NOTE: The diagram does not exactly represent the same set of
 devices and connections depicted in the dialog box snapshot above.</I></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic16"
SRC="../pixmaps/studio-diagram-midi-router-with-ports.jpg" ></P>
<P>
<BR>
<BR></P>
<P>You might wonder about the strange names and numbers. ALSA assigns
 numbers to ports in three ranges. 64: means it is an external MIDI port
 on the first soundcard, which might be connected to a MIDI keyboard,
 sound module, or other noise producing gadget through some sort of
 cable. 65: means it is a virtual port with a supported internal synth
 such as the Sound Blaster Live! on the other side. Software synths like
 Hydrogen, ZynAddSubFX and the like will take numbers at the time
 they're started, on a first-come, first served basis starting at 128:.
 In addition to the number, most of these will have some kind of vaguely
 descriptive text component, such as &quot;Emu10k1 Port 0 (write).&quot; These
 names are provided by the underlying kernel driver, and don't always
 make a lot of sense. That's why Rosegarden allows you give your devices
 a proper name.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="3_2_2">3.2.2 Record Devices</A></H3>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
 Record devices are MIDI keyboards, virtual keyboards, MIDI guitars and
 the like. As record devices are rather less complicated, I will cover
 them first. With a record device, you have no capabilities to describe.
 The only thing Rosegarden can do is read data from it, or not. You may
 name these if you wish, but the<B> Record devices</B> section of this
 dialog is the only place where you will see the names, and I never
 bother to name mine.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
 Rosegarden can record from any number of inputs simultaneously. It will
 create a record device for every read connection it detects. Each of
 these can be set to be an active record device by toggling the
 associated checkbox. Rosegarden keeps track of which port the recorded
 data came from, and what channel was used to transmit the data, but it
 does not currently do anything with this information.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
 In this example, I have both a hardware record device and a software
 record device. These devices were created spontaneously when Rosegarden
 detected the associated duplex read and virtual read connections. I
 have marked both of them &quot;Current&quot; and I can record events from either
 one of them, or both of them at the same time.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
 <IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic17" SRC="../pixmaps/studio-record-devices.png"
></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
<I> NOTE: Rosegarden does not always automatically mark a record device
 as &quot;Current.&quot; If you have a keyboard or similar device, and Rosegarden
 isn't recording anything, this dialog is the first place to look for
 troubleshooting the problem.</I></P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="3_2_3">3.2.3 <B>Play Devices</B></A></H3>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
 Play devices are where all the fun, and all the complexity is. As I
 have mentioned elsewhere, they can be MIDI keyboards, sound modules,
 software synths, samplers, and pretty well anything else that can take
 MIDI input, such as KAMix. (Synth plugins are somewhat different. There
 is a single synth plugin device into which any and all plugins are
 plugged, and it is not a MIDI play device. I will cover synth plugins
 in the next chapter.)</P>
<H4 CLASS="western"><A NAME="3_2_3_1">3.2.3.1 The Easy Road (General
 MIDI Only)</A></H4>
<P>If you have only one play device, and it only uses straight General
 MIDI programs, then you are probably ready to go out of the box. If you
 start Rosegarden with no file to open, it opens a default blank
 document, called<B> autoload.rg</B>. Initially, this will be the system
 default that was installed with Rosegarden. It will load a set of basic
 General MIDI programs and controllers, and will route output from this
 device to the first available play connection. The device a the top of
 the list is always the default device.</P>
<P>Typically this play connection will be routed to the correct
 destination for your MIDI data. If not, all you should have to do is
 adjust the routing table by dialing appropriate connections into the
 associated combo boxes. For example, if Rosegarden defaults to routing
 your output to &quot;64:0 (duplex)&quot; and you do not have any external
 equipment attached to your computer, you probably want to change this
 to point to either 65:0 or something like 128:0 as appropriate.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western"><A NAME="3_2_3_2">3.2.3.2 The Harder Road (Loading
 Device Definitions from the Library)</A></H4>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
 If you have some need beyond the simplest one-device, only-General MIDI
 scenario, you will have to use the bank editor; even if you do not
 intend to edit any banks directly. To load or create a device click on
 the<B> Banks...</B> button to pop up the bank editor dialog.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
 In this example, you can see that I have already imported some programs
 from the soundfont I use on my SB Live!, and I have named the four
 devices &quot;SB Live! (1)&quot; through &quot;SB Live! (4)&quot; for my own convenience.
 This soundfont has programs available in four banks, which are
 displayed as the branches of the tree. The LSB column is not visible in
 this snapshot, but the bank names tell most of the tale. I named the
 last one &quot;Percussion&quot; to set it apart, because that is where this
 soundfont stores the drum kits.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
 You can also see that I have a device called &quot;Soft Synth 2&quot;
 highlighted, and I'm looking at the empty list of programs that make up
 Rosegarden's virtual model for this device. Unlike internal and
 external MIDI equipment, Rosegarden assigns connections to soft synths
 on a first-come, first serve basis, based on the order in which the
 applications are started. It is very easy to wind up with something
 named &quot;Hydrogen&quot; that is actually connected to QSynth. I find I prefer
 to give these things generic names and assign the connections manually
 as required, because I start and stop soft synths as I need them.</P>

 If none of the device models in the library are suitable, and you can't
 turn the program names from a soundfont into a device, then you will
 need to get to work creating your own. You can use an existing file
 from the library as a starting point, or you can create a new device

 Even if you have no real need to start from scratch, you may wish to

 some of the devices in the Library are put together.</P>
<H5 CLASS="western"><A NAME="3_2_3_6_1">3.2.3.6.1 Naming the Device</A></H5>
<P>So that you can avoid confusion, you probably want to replace
 Rosegarden's default &quot;Anonymous MIDI Device 3&quot; type name with something
 more meaningful. Simply double click on the existing name and give your
 virtual model a more descriptive one.</P>
<P>Now that your &quot;Anonymous External Device&quot; has become a &quot;Roland SC-33&quot;
 or what have you, you probably want add a description of its available
 programs and controllers to Rosegarden's model.</P>
<H5 CLASS="western"><A NAME="3_2_3_6_2">3.2.3.6.2 Why Name Programs and
 Controllers?</A></H5>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
 Depending on the capabilities of this device, it might not matter
 whether you define named program changes or not. However, if you do
 intend to transmit programs, bank changes or controllers to the
 equipment--even if you only want to use numbers--you need to define<I>
 something</I> here. Rosegarden's model of your equipment will only
 include what you define here, and anything you leave empty will not be
 available for your use. If you don't let Rosegarden know that program
 number 97 can play something, it will never allow you set a track to
 use that program number.</P>
<H5 CLASS="western"><A NAME="3_2_3_6_3">3.2.3.6.3 Gathering Information</A>
</H5>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
 The key to success here is having as much information about the
 equipment as possible. You need to know what programs it can use, and
 how the banks are numbered. If you have no idea, you may have to try
 loading &quot;raw-numbers.rgd&quot; from the Library, which I created as a way of
 providing a generic everything to everyone placeholder just to fill up
 the slots and allow program changes to be transmitted. Beyond the
 essential fact that you must understand your equipment to describe it,
 there are really only two special cases worth mentioning here.</P>
<H5 CLASS="western"><A NAME="3_2_3_6_4">3.2.3.6.4 Variations</A></H5>
<P>Some equipment uses a method of sorting programs into banks in such a
 way that the programs in bank 0 0 are the standard General MIDI
 instruments, and the programs in the remaining banks are variations on
 those instruments. Roland's GS standard is a prime example of this.
 Bank 0 0, program 1 is &quot;Piano 1&quot; and bank 0 8, program 1 is &quot;Piano 1w.&quot;
 In order to make it easy to take advantage of this relationship,
 Rosegarden offers the ability to display programs in secondary banks as
 variations. You may choose to enable this, and to show the variation
 list based on either the LSB or MSB value.</P>

 Checkbox</A></H5>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
 Finally, you may have noticed that Rosegarden only allows you one set
 of program changes per bank address. The exception to this rule is that
 you may define a parallel set of program changes if the [x] Percussion
 box is checked. For example, if you have a synth that interprets
 standard program changes in bank 0 0 on channel 10 as drum kit changes
 (like GS) then you can tell Rosegarden how to use them.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
 The process is a bit fiddly. First you have to use the<B> Add</B>
 button to create a new, empty bank. It will take a number other than 0
 0 because 0 0 is already in use. Check the [x] Percussion box for this
 new bank, and then dial its LSB and MSB values back down to 0 0 (or
 wherever they need to be for your implementation) and enter the names
 of drum kits as programs.</P>

<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="3_4_1">3.4.1 Lilypond Headers</A></H3>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium">The About tab starts off
 with some default properties. You can modify or delete these, and you
 can add new properties. The four defaults will be translated into
 Lilypond during an export. If you wish to use any other strings in your
 Lilypond headers, you can add them here by creating properties of that
 name, then binding your custom strings with them.. For example,
 &quot;instrument,&quot; &quot;dedication,&quot; or &quot;poet.&quot;</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="3_4_2">3.4.2 Audio Directory</A></H3>
<P>From the Audio tab, you can configure a new directory for audio
 files. Rosegarden will use this path for recording new files, and it's
 the first place it will look when you import audio segments. By
 default, this is ~/rosegarden. If this path doesn't exist, you won't be
 able to record audio, so either create that directory or configure
 Rosegarden to look somewhere else here.</P>
<P>You should get in the habit of creating a new audio directory for
 each document you create in which you intend to use audio segments, as
 I will detail in another chapter.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="3_4_3">3.4.3 Custom Colors</A></H3>
<P>Rosegarden can colorize segments and controllers. Custom colors are
 defined here.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">3.5 <A NAME="2_5_5"></A>Saving Your Studio as the
 Default</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">Now that
 you've gotten your studio configured, you'll want to make it your
 default, so that you can avoid having to go through this entire ordeal
 every time you start a new composition.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in"><B>
Composition -&gt; Studio -&gt; Save Current Document as Default Studio</B>
 will save the current document as your local<B> autoload.rg</B> file.
 This becomes the default for all new documents you create, but it will
 have no effect on documents that you've already created, or documents
 you load from other sources. The studio belongs to each individual
 composition.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
 This default studio is just like any ordinary<B> .rg</B> file, and that
 means any segments, track labels, instrument assignments, etc. that you
 have in the current document will be saved, and will subsequently be
 loaded each time you create a new document.</P>
