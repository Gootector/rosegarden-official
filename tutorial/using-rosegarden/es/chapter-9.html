<P>I have lost all interest in writing this for the moment, and I just
 want to get it finished, done, put to bed and out the door, so I can go
 work on some bugs and try to get Rosegarden 1.0 itself finished, done,
 put to bed and out the door. There are a number of things I didn't
 cover in this first edition. If someone wants to pick this up for
 publication, I may write them. If not, then what you have is what you
 have for the time being. I will need to write an updated version for
 1.1 anyway, and I hope to get into some of the areas I have left
 uncovered at that time.</P>
<P>Some things I didn't mention:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<P>importing Hydrogen patterns</P>
</LI>
<LI>
<P>merging MIDI files</P>
</LI>
<LI>
<P>using the audio file manager/managing audio projects</P>
</LI>
<LI>
<P>mastering (&quot;bounce to disk&quot;)</P>
</LI>
<LI>
<P>various notation hack workarounds to accomplish things in spite of
 some of the limitations of this initial release of the notation editor</P>
</LI>
<LI>
<P>???</P>
</LI>
</UL>
<P>All of this and more will come in due time, but not tomorrow, not
 next week, not next month. Maybe spring 2005. I have done little else
 for two months but work on this book, and I am just not in the groove
 anymore. It is too forced, and it is time to let it rest a bit.</P>
