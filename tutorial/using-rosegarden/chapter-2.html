	In order to share a common frame of reference, let's turn on

	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">Unless
	you begin with an imported MIDI file, it all starts with a segment,
	which is a convenient container that stores a bit of note data or
	audio. Segments are somewhat similar to layers in an image editing
	program such as the GIMP. They can be cut, pasted, split,
	re-combined, overlapped and pretty much rearranged at will, and are
	very flexible.</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">

	Autosave</H2>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
	I'll conclude this section by mentioning a very useful feature that
	doesn't quite fit in anywhere else. As always, &quot;save early,
	save often&quot; is the mantra of computer users everywhere, and
	can't be stressed enough. It's never a bad idea to take time out to
	save your work.</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
	However, Rosegarden attempts to save you from yourself.</P>
	<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
	If the GUI crashes for some reason, or you have a power outage or
	the like, the next time you start Rosegarden and attempt to load the
	file you were working on, you'll be presented with the option of
	loading the autosave file instead. If you hadn't yet saved the file,
	you'll find it in your ~/autosave directory with a basic name of
	&quot;untitled.&quot;</P>
	<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">
	The autosave interval defaults to 60 seconds. Configure it via the<B>
	Settings</B> menu.</P>

	By now, you're probably wondering when we're going to do something
	useful, so let's go take a look at the studio. Before we continue,
	you'll want to dump anything you've just been piddling with and
	start with a fresh new document for reasons I'll explain shortly.</P>
	<H2 STYLE="border: none; padding: 0in"><A NAME="2_5"></A>2.5 The
	Studio</H2>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">Before
	importing anything into Rosegarden, we're going to want to set up
	instrument definitions for all of our MIDI devices. One quirk with
	Rosegarden is that If there is no<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->
	instrument definition for a particular program/bank change, then
	that information will disappear when the data is imported, so
	configuring the studio is something best done early on. If, for
	example, you wish to import a document that has GS program changes,
	you'll need to configure your studio accordingly beforehand.</P>
	<H3 STYLE="border: none; padding: 0in"><A NAME="2_5_1"></A>2.5.1 No
	Global Instrument Definitions</H3>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
	Every native Rosegarden file contains a studio definition that
	describes your MIDI landsacpe. The idea is that once you have
	properly configured your studio it will be very easy to control all
	of your equipment without having to worry about the details of what
	is connected where. In practice, it works quite well, but it does
	present some special considerations that will probably seem somewhat
	strange to you if you cut your teeth on some other package before
	trying Rosegarden.</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
	Every native Rosegarden composition (.rg) file contains a studio,
	along with note events and other types of data, and this studio
	definition remains with the file for its lifetime. If you create
	several files and then change some aspect of your MIDI landscape,
	you'll need to correct the studio component of every existing file,
	as there's currently no facility for making the default setup
	override the settings contained in these files.</P>

	Configuring MIDI Connections

	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
	You'll be presented with a dialog that resembles this one:</P>
	<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">

	<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
	Rosegarden recognizes two types of MIDI ports. A device can be a
	Play Device or a Record Device. A duplex MIDI Port such as that
	found on my Sound Blaster, which provides both MIDI IN and MIDI OUT,
	is divided into two separate devices.</P>
	<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
	In the above example, you see that Device 1 is my external MIDI OUT
	device, Device 2 is MIDI IN, and I have an empty slot with no
	connection that I've reserved for use with Fluid Synth, which wasn't
	running when I took that snapshot.</P>
	<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
	Note that most of the items in this dialog box are read-only. You
	can change the connections around, but cannot rename anything from
	here. The names, such as &quot;Roland SC-33&quot; come from the
	instrument definitions which are attached to this particular device.
	We'll look at how to change those directly.</P>
	<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
	In the meantime, what you<I> can<!--SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"--></I>
	do from this dialog is re-arrange which device slots are connected
	to which hardware (or virtual hardware, in the case of a soft synth)
	paths, and you can create or delete devices at will. One use for
	that is to create a device for an ALSA soft synth that isn't
	currently running, so that you can assign programs to it in advance,
	and have everything ready to go at such time as you decide to start
	up that synth, and the path to that particular synth becomes
	available to Rosegarden.</P>
	<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
	<I>NOTE: These empty slots are given default connections in the
	order that new connections become available to Rosegarden. If you
	intend to have Fluid Synth on Device 3 and Hydrogen on Device 4, and
	you wish to set up meaningful program changes for those synths in
	advance, you'll need to be sure to start those applications in the
	correct order, or else you'll have to come back to this dialog and
	switch the connections around whenever you've changed the order in
	which they are detected.</I></P>

	To load an instrument definition, you'll first want to select a

	The first level of the tree is the path to the MIDI hardware (or

	(Most/Least Significant Byte), to change banks, and their
	implementation is device-dependent. Rosegarden allows you only one

	you can take advantage of a very convenient new feature. Rosegarden
	now allows you to import the program names right out of the
	soundfont by navigating to the<B> .sf2</B> file and selecting it as
	the source for the import of banks.</P>

	Creating A Custom Instrument Definition</H3>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
	If none of the bank definitions in the library fit, and you can't
	load the program names out of a soundfont, you can use an existing
	file from the library as a starting point, or you can create a new
	instrument definition completely from scratch.</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
	Taking the example of my Roland SC-33, I looked at the
	implementation chart in the back of the manual, and then decided how
	I wanted to arrange the banks. Since the LSB/MSB address of the bank
	is what makes it unique, and they can actually all have identical
	names, I had to give some real thought to the best way to organize
	my available patches in order to make getting to what I wanted to
	find as simple and logical as possible.</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
	I tried to come up with names for the banks that roughly reflect
	what sort of variations are available in each one, though it's
	somewhat imperfect because Roland wasn't very orderly in deciding
	what to put where, and there are some few melodic instruments in
	banks that are normally only used for sound effects. Depending on
	your hardware, you, too, may face similar compromises.</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
	Once you've decided what your instrument definition needs to
	contain, and how it should be organized, entering your data is a
	straightforward matter. Use the<B> Add Bank</B> and<B> Delete Bank</B>
	or<B> Delete All Banks</B> buttons as necessary to pave the way,
	then start filling out the dialog box. If you have similar sets of
	program changes in two different banks, you can copy one from the
	other using<B> Copy Programs</B> and<B> Paste Programs</B> to save
	yourself some typing.</P>

	If you don't enter a string for a particular program number, you
	won't have to scroll through that slot when choosing an instrument
	later on. This is very convenient if you have a bank that only
	contains a few available programs, as there is no need to scroll
	through a lot of useless entries on your way to the few slots that
	actually do something. This is especially useful for some of my
	Roland banks that only have a few program changes that are widely
	scattered.</P>

	If, on the other hand, you<I> want<!--SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"--></I>
	to have every program number available, even if you don't wish to
	assign particular names to some or all of them, you might want to
	begin by using<B> Import Banks</B> and loading<B> raw-numbers.rgd</B>
	into that slot. That will populate the program dialog with numbers,
	and you can replace some of them with text, or else leave all of
	them as numbers.</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
	Once you've defined the names for your program changes, you can save
	the definition to disk with<B> Export Banks</B>.</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">If you

	A track or tracks are connected to this device, but this is not

	In the above example, if I navigate to channel 1, the active track
	will automatically be assigned to the instrument &quot;Piano 1.&quot;
	(This makes it easy to assign multiple tracks to the same
	device/channel/instrument combination.) Channel 2, on the other
	hand, doesn't currently have an instrument assignment. If I want to
	use channel 2 for this track, I'll have to use the Instrument
	Parameters box to assign an instrument to this channel, as I'll

	your MIDI implementation puts percussion into a separate bank. Fluid
	Synth and other soundfont users are in luck here, as most soundfonts
	define drum kits in bank 1:0. Users of Roland GS and other, similar
	standards, where &quot;percussion mode&quot; is controlled via SysEx
	instead of a bank change, will have to make do without having names
	for their drum kits defined. I'll explain how to work around this
