DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

"Using Rosegarden" has undergone numerous structural changes over its
lifespan.  This has left me with a somewhat bizarre directory structure.

The root directory of this CVS module is tutorial/  It contains the
entry-level web site, consisting of various Rosegarden-related graphics and an
index.html that links to the available versions of "Using Rosegarden."

The root directory of "Using Rosegarden" itself is tutorial/using-rosegarden
which is a bit of a legacy.  It should contain only subdirectories.

using-rosegarden/docs			you are here

using-rosegarden/admin			directory to house some build scripts

using-rosegarden/pixmaps		where all pixmaps used in various
					chapters go - see note

using-rosegarden/en-src			the HTML sources for the master,
					English version

using-rosegarden/en			the "compiled" publication version;
					not to be edited by hand

The en-src and pixmaps directories are the heart and soul of "Using
Rosegarden."  I own the master .html files in en-src and the English language
pixmaps, and you are not invited to change anything.


GETTING STARTED

If you're interested in doing a new translation, drop me a line at
dmmcintyr@users.sourceforge.net and I'll set you up a ??-src directory for
your language.  I'll take care of the administrativa, so you needn't concern
yourself with compiling the sources into a finished product, or with publishing
anything.

I'm using htmldoc to assemble all of this, and the navigation headers it
provides are in English.  My docmake script will take care of translating
these automatically, but I do need translations for the following strings so
that I can make the necessary additions to the build script.

	Contents, Previous, Next

Make sure I now which is which.

(NOTE:  There are probably encoding issues with non-Latin languages.  I will
probably need additional assistance tweaking up my build script to handle
these translations.  A quick test seems to reveal I'm going to run into
trouble with Russian, for example.)


PUBLICATION

The build system is in CVS, but I'd prefer to do all the publication myself.
Commit (or send me) your own ??-src/*.html files and leave the rest to me.


PIXMAPS

All my screenshots are in English.  If this bothers you, feel free to make new
screenshots in your target language.  I'm not terribly concerned with keeping
the look and feel the same, so go ahead and use whatever styles/themes/colors
you normally use.  I suggest that it's probably a good idea to use as many of
the original pixmaps as possible, to save yourself needless toil, but I leave
it up to you, the translator, to make all final decisions about the pixmaps
you include with your translation.

There are many diagrams published as pixmaps that probably need translation as
well.  The vector sources for these are not available in CVS, and I would
prefer not to clutter up CVS with even more binary files.  If the prospect of
replacing the text with the GIMP is too daunting, I can send you the .sxd
originals so you can export new graphics.

To avoid breaking my fragile build system, all the pixmaps need to go into the
using-rosegarden/pixmaps directory.  Use the original filenames with your
language code tacked on as an extra extension, like:

	segment-parameters-box.png.de


THANKS

Thanks for your interest, and your hard work!  I know this hasn't been easy to
translate.  Your only consolation is that it hasn't been easy to write either.
