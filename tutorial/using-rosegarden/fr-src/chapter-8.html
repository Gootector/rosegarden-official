<H1>Notation</H1>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; font-style: normal"><FONT FACE="Arial">I
have mentioned elsewhere that Rosegarden is not purely a MIDI
sequencer, and that it is not possible to create or manage raw MIDI
events directly. Neither is it purely a notation editor. Applications
dedicated to notation typically work with notation internally, and
any MIDI performance capability they have is the result of
interpreting that notation and translating it into MIDI. These
applications typically do a rudimentary job at best in the MIDI
arena, and the results almost always sound very artificial and
mechanical. At the other extreme, applications dedicated entirely to
MIDI sequencing tend to have rudimentary notation capabilities, and
it is often all but impossible to produce legible notation with these
unless the MIDI data itself has been beaten into a state of
mechanical purity that causes the results to sound just as artificial
as that produced by dedicated notation packages.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; font-style: normal"><FONT FACE="Arial">Rosegarden
sits squarely in the middle between these two extremes, possessing
most of the features of both, with few compromises. In order to allow
the richness of a human performance to coexist with legible notation,
every note event, whether recorded, imported, or entered by hand,
contains not one, but two different duration properties. One duration
is used to determine how long the note will sound for MIDI
performance, while the other is used for displaying clean, legible
notation. This exciting feature makes Rosegarden the only application
I know that allows you to have your cake and eat it too.</FONT></P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Notation Editor Overview</H2>
<P>In order to open the notation editor, you must have at least one
segment available. You can open any number of segments on any number
of tracks simultaneously by selecting the segment or segments you
wish to edit, and then right clicking on one of them and choosing
&quot;Open in Notation Editor&quot; from the context menu.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-open-in-notation-editor.png" NAME="Graphic1" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=190 HEIGHT=213 BORDER=0></P>
<P>Additionally, the notation editor is the normal default, so you
can also open it either by pressing <B>Enter</B>, or by double
clicking on a segment. (You can configure this behavior from <B>Settings
-&gt; Configure Rosegarden</B>.)</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-default-editor.png" NAME="Graphic2" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=456 HEIGHT=72 BORDER=0></P>
<P>After you have opened it, you will see something a bit like this.
Your screen will probably look somewhat different, because this
particular example is in multiple page layout mode, which is not the
default.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-overview.png" NAME="Graphic3" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=532 HEIGHT=351 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><I>(I should have done this initial screenshot in the
default, linear layout mode, but I chose this mode instead so I could
showcase my favorite piece. This obscure, rarely-performed concerto
has gotten me through some trying times, and I love it like no
other.)</I></P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Notation Toolbars</H3>
<P>The notation editor is just bristling with toolbars big and small.
I will defer many of them until time to describe their function in
more detail.</P>
<P>The standard toolbar includes print and save icons, as well as the
usual cut/copy/paste tools.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-toolbar.png" NAME="Graphic4" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=299 HEIGHT=28 BORDER=0></P>
<P>The tools toolbar has several of the same tools found in the main
window, but it adds icons for step recording and the quantizer.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-tools-toolbar.png" NAME="Graphic5" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=179 HEIGHT=28 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>The transport toolbar is the same as the one found in
the matrix.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">The
layout toolbar allows you to change the way notation is displayed in
various ways. You can switch between linear layout mode, continuous
page mode, and multiple page mode. The linear mode scrolls
continuously off to the right, and it is the only mode that has
rulers. The continuous page mode displays notation formatted as
though it were a printed page, but it scrolls continuously toward the
bottom. Multiple page mode breaks the notation into discrete pages,
and provides a pager to allow you to get access to the portion of the
wish to view or edit.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">You can
use the <B>Font:</B> combo box to choose among the standard Feta
(courtesy of the Lilypond project), a bitmap version of Feta called
&quot;Feta Pixmaps,&quot; and the bitmap font used by a previous
incarnation of Rosegarden, called &quot;RG21.&quot; The <B>Size:</B>
box functions somewhat like the zoom slider in the other views,
allowing you to magnify or reduce your view (but not your printouts
or exports.) The <B>Spacing:</B> box allows you tweak how much space
Rosegarden uses when laying out the notation horizontally.</P>

<I>TIP: It is also possible to use fonts from packages like Finale if
you prefer. See the &quot;Note Fonts&quot;
(help:/rosegarden/nv-note-fonts.html) and &quot;Customizing
Rosegarden&quot; (help:/rosegarden/developers.html) topics in the

<H2 CLASS="western">Opening Multiple Staffs</H2>
<P>Many posters on the rosegarden-user mailing list use Rosegarden to
work with piano notation, so I have chosen a simple flute with piano
accompaniment arrangement as the place in which to demonstrate
various entry and editing features.</P>
<P>I mentioned in the introduction to this chapter that Rosegarden
has made few compromises in order to be able to do a bang up job as
both a notation editor and a MIDI sequencer. This example also serves
to highlight one of those compromises. It is not possible to display
an entire piano part on one grand staff. Neither is it possible to do
a good, clear job of writing multiple parts or voices on the same
staff. Due to both of these limitations, you will probably want to
write the bass and treble parts in different segments, and thus on
separate staffs. These segments can be in the same track, but if they
are exactly the same length, and they overlap each other exactly, it
will be impossible to select whichever segment lies on the bottom.
For this reason, I recommend putting the right and left hand parts on
different tracks as well.</P>
<P>For this example, I have created three segments on three tracks.
I've labeled the top one &quot;flute&quot; and have assigned it to a
device and instrument that will play a flute program on channel 1.
The remaining two tracks are labeled by right or left hand, and they
are both assigned to the same piano instrument, which will play using
a piano program on channel 2. I have selected all three of these
segments in order to open them in a combined notation view:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-segments.png" NAME="Graphic20" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=456 HEIGHT=119 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><BR><BR>
</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Notation Basics</H2>
<P>Unless you have changed the default notation display mode, the
notation view should open in its default linear layout mode, like
this:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-empty-segments-editing.png" NAME="Graphic18" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=532 HEIGHT=351 BORDER=0></P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Notation Rulers</H3>
<P>Just like the matrix view, there are two distinct sets of rulers
here. At the top of the window you will find a tempo ruler, a special
raw note ruler, which I will describe later on, and an an insertion
ruler for manipulating the insertion cursor. As in the matrix, the
insertion cursor determines the point at which notation elements are
inserted or pasted.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-rules.png" NAME="Graphic11" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=228 HEIGHT=224 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>In a multiple staff situation such as this, you will
notice that the insertion cursor only spans a single staff. This lets
you know which staff is the active target for various operations.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Clefs</H3>
<P>There are at least two ways to enter a clef. Regardless of which
you use, you first need to position the insertion cursor at the
correct insertion point, if it isn't there already. Select the target
staff by double clicking on it. Then you can use <B>Segment -&gt; Add
Clef Change</B> from the menu. A clef chooser dialog will appear,
allowing you to choose from a variety of different clefs in different
<I>8va</I> configurations by clicking on the various arrows. The
up/down arrows change between <I>8va</I> and <I>15ma</I> up or down,
respectively, and the left/right arrows cycle through the various
available clefs. The dialog will remember the clef you used last
time, making it more convenient to insert multiple clefs. (There is
no option to insert a clef in more than one place at once, so you
will have to add a clef to each staff manually.)</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">The <B>Existing notes following clef
change</B> portion of this dialog is particularly useful in a
situation where you began entering notation before choosing a clef.
Rosegarden thinks in treble, and treble is the default if no clef is
present. If <B>[x] Transpose into appropriate octave</B> is selected,
Rosegarden will attempt to find the best transposition of any
existing notation relative to the new clef. (If this has undesired
consequences, as it sometimes does, then you can transpose again by
hand, as I will discuss in due course.)</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-clef-dialog.png" NAME="Graphic22" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=228 HEIGHT=255 BORDER=0></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">If you prefer, you can use the Clefs
toolbar. (The Clefs toolbar is not toggled on by default.)</P>
<P><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-clefs-toolbar.png" NAME="Graphic9" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=116 HEIGHT=54 BORDER=0></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">To use the toolbar, first switch to
the 
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-arrow-cursor.png" NAME="Graphic21" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=27 HEIGHT=27 BORDER=0>
cursor, then select one of the clefs from the Clefs toolbar. Click in
one of the staffs, and the selected clef should be inserted. If you
find a dead zone near the time signature, you may need to click
around a bit until you find the magic spot.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Key Signatures</H4>
<P>Key signatures are added in a similar fashion to clefs. Position
the insertion cursor as appropriate, select the target staff, and
then use <B>Segment -&gt; Add Key Change</B> from the menu. You will
be presented with a dialog that allows you to choose from all major
and minor keys up through seven accidentals.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-key-signature-dialog.png" NAME="Graphic23" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=203 HEIGHT=304 BORDER=0></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">In addition to changing the key
signature itself, you can use the <B>Scope</B> controls to change
whether Rosegarden will insert the new key signature only in the
target staff, or in all staffs (segments) at this point in time. You
may also decide whether Rosegarden should favor the existing pitches,
possibly creating new accidentals in the new key, or favor the
current accidentals, which might change the pitches in the new key.
Rosegarden can also attempt to transpose the notation into the new
key.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Tempo and Time Signature</H3>
<P>Both of these are attributes of the composition as a whole, and
when they change, they affect all segments, and, accordingly, all
staffs at the same time. It is not possible to have different time
signatures or different tempi in different segments a the same time.
These attributes can be controlled from the main window, but they can
also be edited from the notation view for convenience.</P>
<P>I already discussed the associated dialogs for both of these in
<A HREF="chapter-3.html">Chapter 3</A>. To open the tempo and time
signature editor, double click on the tempo ruler, or on a time
signature.</P>
<P>If you wish, for example, to insert a time signature change from
4/4 to 12/8 at bar 3, move the insertion cursor (by clicking on the
top ruler) to the appropriate time, then use <B>Composition -&gt; Add
Time Signature Change</B> to open the time signature editor dialog.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-time-sig.png" NAME="Graphic57" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=418 HEIGHT=299 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">The time signature will
appear in accordance with the various options that have been chosen.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-time-sig1.png" NAME="Graphic58" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=456 HEIGHT=125 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">Notice in particular
example that the measure following this one did not expand to become
full after this change. Time signature adjustments will not resize
segments. Instead, the beats are reallocated as required, as is
perhaps better illustrated by this 4/4 to 5/4 example. Instead of two
measures with four beats, it has become one with five and one with
three.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Entering Notes and Rests</H3>
<P>Rosegarden provides a variety of ways to enter notes, providing
tools for both mouse- and keyboard-oriented composers. Perhaps the
quickest way to get started is to use the several associated toolbars
and point and click a few notes into existence. (I will cover the
other methods a bit later on.)</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Notes</H4>
<P>Switch to the 
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-arrow-cursor.png" NAME="Graphic24" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=27 HEIGHT=27 BORDER=0>
tool, which puts the editor into insert mode. To enter a note, choose
either a standard or a dotted duration from the Notes toolbar. Then
click in one of the staffs to insert a note at that location.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-notes-toolbar.png" NAME="Graphic16" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=464 HEIGHT=54 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-enter-first-note.png" NAME="Graphic25" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=266 HEIGHT=106 BORDER=0></P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Rests</H4>
<P>Rests are treated as negative space, and Rosegarden attempts to
pad out the measure with rests automatically. However, it is often
useful, even necessary, to enter them manually. For example, switch
to the 8<SUP>th</SUP> note duration and then try to enter an 8<SUP>th</SUP>
note on the far side of that quarter rest, leaving an 8<SUP>th</SUP>
rest in between. It's impossible. You'll wind up with a result like
this every time:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-enter-first-note1.png" NAME="Graphic26" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=276 HEIGHT=98 BORDER=0></P>
<P>The trick to this is to manually insert a rest, which causes
Rosegarden to subdivide the beat; giving you a place to insert your
new note. To change this note into a rest, select an appropriate
duration from the Rests toolbar, then click on the note head to
replace it with a rest.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-rests-toolbar.png" NAME="Graphic17" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=402 HEIGHT=54 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-enter-first-note2.png" NAME="Graphic27" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=277 HEIGHT=92 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Now you can change to an 8<SUP>th</SUP> note on the
Notes toolbar and enter the remaining note in the correct location.</P>
<P ALIGN=RIGHT><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-enter-first-note3.png" NAME="Graphic28" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=291 HEIGHT=104 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Notice as you do this that the insertion cursor
advances to the next beat division. Remember that you can reposition
it using the insertion ruler. What you cannot do, however, is move it
to an arbitrary point in time. It always snaps along beat divisions,
depending on how the measure is divided, and it can sometimes be a
bit fiddling getting a not just where you want it. Particularly if
you're adding a new note to existing notation, as when turning a
single note into a chord, for example.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Chords</H4>
<P>When using the toolbars and other graphical tools to insert notes,
creating chords is as simple as clicking in a new note above or below
an existing one.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-enter-first-note4.png" NAME="Graphic14" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=296 HEIGHT=119 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>You can also select a series of notes spaced out over
time,</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 3.94in"><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-chords.png" NAME="Graphic53" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=91 HEIGHT=76 BORDER=0>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>then use the 
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/icon-make-chord.png" NAME="Graphic52" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=19 BORDER=0>
icon... 
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>to pull them into a chord. 
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-chords1.png" NAME="Graphic54" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=83 HEIGHT=86 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><BR><BR>
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Nudging an Incorrect Pitch</H4>
<P>In the preceding example, I entered what was trying to be an F
major chord in the key of E<SUB>b</SUB>. The easiest way to fix the
errant A<SUB>b</SUB> from here is to nudge it with the arrow keys on
the keyboard. First select the note in question, then raise it a
halfstep by hitting the up arrow key once. (I could also have avoided
writing the note incorrectly in the first place, as I will explain
later on.)</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-enter-first-note5.png" NAME="Graphic29" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=293 HEIGHT=104 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>You can transpose individual notes or entire selections
in this fashion, one semitone at a time. The accidentals along the
way will be based on the key signature. Flats in a flat key, sharps
in a sharp key. If you want to write a sharp in a flat key, you'll
have to change it manually, as I will explain further on.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>You can also raise or lower pitches an octave at a time
with <B>Ctrl+Up</B>/<B>Down</B>.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</H4>
<H4 CLASS="western">Erasing Notes</H4>
<P>In order to pave the way for the next example, this is a good time
to introduce the 
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-erase-cursor.png" NAME="Graphic30" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=26 BORDER=0>
cursor. Select it and then click on individual notes to erase them.
To follow along at home, remove the F major chord and step back to a
time when there was just an A<SUB>b</SUB> here.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Avoiding Multiple Voices</H4>
<P>Rosegarden cannot handle situations involving multiple musical
lines written on the same staff very well at all. From a MIDI
performance perspective, there is no reason why you cannot have an
entire violin concerto in a single segment, and you can manipulate
this data to your heart's content with the other editors, but the
notation editor will never produce good results attempting to
interpret data like this into legible notation. It attempts to
display the notation as a single line, and this can lead to a great
deal of awkwardness. For example, select a dotted 8<SUP>th</SUP> note
duration from the Notes toolbar and then add a note above the first
quarter note. Rosegarden splits and ties the quarter note and
displays the whole mess as a chord.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-counterpoint.png" NAME="Graphic31" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=318 HEIGHT=120 BORDER=0></P>
<P>You can undo this if you do so immediately, but if you wish to go
back later on and erase the top note, the bottom note will remain a
split-and-tied pair permanently, because it has become two separate
events.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-counterpoint1.png" NAME="Graphic32" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=295 HEIGHT=93 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>If you erase both of these notes, you wind up with some
unwieldy looking rests.</P>
<P ALIGN=RIGHT><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-counterpoint2.png" NAME="Graphic33" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=308 HEIGHT=80 BORDER=0></P>
<P>All of these problems can be solved, and no permanent harm has
been done, but the fact remains that Rosegarden simply is not able to
cope with this kind of situation elegantly.</P>
<P><I>NOTE: Part writing is one of the most often-requested features,
and is almost certain to be implemented in some fashion at some point
in the future.</I></P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Making Selections</H4>
<P>Just like in the other views, you can select groups of notes to
isolate them from the rest of a staff. Each note will sound as you
select it.</P>
<P>Switch back to the 
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-arrow-cursor.png" NAME="Graphic34" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=27 HEIGHT=27 BORDER=0>
tool. You can select individual notes by shift clicking them, or you
can make a sweep selection by clicking and dragging the blue
selection box until it includes the notes you want.</P>
<P>You can select an entire measure at once by double clicking it, or
you can select an entire staff by triple clicking.</P>
<P>As elsewhere, you can also hold down <B>Shift</B> while clicking
on notes to make a non-contiguous selection of scattered, individual
notes.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Collapsing Rests</H4>
<P>If you find yourself in an ugly situation such as the preceding
example, you can instruct Rosegarden to recalculate and collapse the
rests. First you will need to make a selection, then use <B>Adjust -&gt;
Rests...</B> to tidy things up.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">If you choose <B>Normalize Rests</B>,
(or use the <B>Ctrl</B>+<B>N</B> shortcut) Rosegarden will attempt to
reduce the rests along beat divisions.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-normalize-rests.png" NAME="Graphic35" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=285 HEIGHT=78 BORDER=0></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">If you choose <B>Collapse Rests</B>,
Rosegarden will squeeze them down into the smallest possible space,
irrespective of beat divisions.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-collapse-rests.png" NAME="Graphic36" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=271 HEIGHT=85 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><I>TIP: I find I have to normalize rests quite often
after erasing notes or otherwise rearranging rhythms. Rosegarden can
come up with some pretty strange looking results sometimes, but a
select-and-</I><B>Ctrl</B>+<B>N</B> <I>usually fixes it right up.</I></P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Accidentals</H4>
<P>I already mentioned that you can nudge an errant note into place
with the arrow keys, but what if you need to enter an accidental
intentionally? The Accidentals toolbar allows you to control the
accidental state of entered notes.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-accidentals-toolbar.png" NAME="Graphic8" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=54 BORDER=0></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P>The default &quot;No accidental&quot; mode 
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-no-accidental.png" NAME="Graphic108" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=18 HEIGHT=21 BORDER=0>
will enter notation that follows the key signature. You can override
this with any of the other choices.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of particular note is the
&quot;Follow previous accidental&quot; mode, 
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-last-accidental.png" NAME="Graphic109" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=19 HEIGHT=22 BORDER=0>
which will enter the note with the same accidental as was last used
for this particular line or space. If you enter an F# in bar 3, then
click on the F line in bar 6, it will be sharp if the Accidentals
toolbar is in this mode.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To enter this phrase from J.

<H5 CLASS="western">Respelling</H5>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In Bach, I often encounter
situations where a passage is written in a different key without a
key change. Rosegarden will use flats in a flat key, and sharps in a
sharp key, but this sometimes reads poorly. Take this passage for
example (in the key of D<SUB>m</SUB>):</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second measure here
could read better if the D<SUB>b</SUB> were respelled as a C<SUB>#</SUB>.
To correct this, <B>Notes -&gt; Adjust -&gt; Respell with Sharp</B>is
just the trick. (Otherwise you would have to arrow the note down to
C, transposing it in the process, choose sharp from <B>Accidentals</B>
toolbar, then click on it to sharpen it. Or else erase the D<SUB>b</SUB>
and put a new C<SUB>#</SUB> in its place, and lose any human
performance duration in the process. I will cover the last point in
some depth a bit later.)</P>

<H5 CLASS="western">Cautionary Accidentals</H5>
<P>To make the passage I just demonstrated resemble the score I have
in front of me, it is necessary to adjust the way Rosegarden handles
accidental changes. The original score notates a flat on both Es, and
puts a natural sign on the first E natural in the following measure.
Producing this result requires changing two of the default behaviors
and then closing and reopening the notation view to see the new
options in action.</P>
<P>Accidental behavior is configured via various controls on the
<B>Settings -&gt; Configure Rosegarden -&gt; Notation -&gt;
Accidentals</B> page. To achieve the particular results I want in
this case, I need to make accidentals only affect the octave in which
they are written, and I need to require explicit cancellations in the
following bars. (There are also options to use cautionary accidentals
in parentheses in these cases, as opposed to explicit accidentals.)</P>

<P>After you have entered a note, you can use <B>Ctrl+.</B> to cycle

<H5 CLASS="western">Quicker Triplets</H5>
<P>As a shortcut to entering the notes as normal durations and then

<P>You can also toggle this using the

icon if you prefer. Both this icon and the status bar will change to
reflect the fact that you are in triplet entry mode, and the duration
you have selected will effectively be 1/3 of the normal duration. If
you enter 8 G then you will be inserting triplet 8<SUP>th</SUP>

the &quot;Do a deer, a female deer&quot; song. You can enter pitches
in this fashion in Rosegarden, providing a quick way to enter notes
relative to the tonic note of the key you happen to be in.
(Unfortunately for foreign readers, most other languages ascribe
absolute pitches to these words, so &quot;do&quot; = C. In the
English speaking world, &quot;do&quot; is only C in the key of C
major. In D minor, do = D, and so on.)</P>

<H4 CLASS="western">Micro-Positioning of Notation Elements 
</H4>
<P>If you have some particular reason why you would prefer not to
change the stem or slur directions around, it is still possible to
improve our badly-rendered sample slur. You can re-position virtually
any notation element to take matters into your own hands and give
things a nudge when required. Simply select the element or elements
you wish to reposition, hold down the shift key, then drag them
wherever you want. Their new positions will be remembered, stored
with the composition, and printed, although this micro-positioning is
not exportable to external notation formats like Lilypond.</P>
<P>You can take this to ridiculous extremes if you wish. I'll show
you one example of a way to work around one of Rosegarden's
limitations by taking advantage of the no-holds-barred nature of this
feature later on, but it is not usually terribly useful to abuse your
power to this degree:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-select-for-slur2.png" NAME="Graphic41" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=456 HEIGHT=136 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>However, when used in a reasonable fashion, this gives
Rosegarden the ability to produce quite satisfying results. In this
case I have gone back to the original stem and slur directions as
computed, and have moved the wayward slur just a trifle.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>From this... 
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-select-for-slur1.png" NAME="Graphic46" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH=197 HEIGHT=89 BORDER=0>
to this...<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-select-for-slur3.png" NAME="Graphic42" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH=201 HEIGHT=94 BORDER=0>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">If you find you've made a
complete mess of things, you can use <B>Adjust -&gt; Fine Positioning
-&gt; Restore Computed Positions</B> to revert the position of the
selected element, or elements to normal.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Moving Notes</H4>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">Now that I have mentioned
micro-positioning, I should point out that you can also move notes
and some other notation elements in time as well as space by dragging
and dropping them. Notes can be moved to any visible staff, and to
any point in time. If you are dragging a selection, only the &quot;root&quot;
element will move, and the remaining notes will fill in on either
side of it, as appropriate.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">For example, I entered a
bit of notation in the first staff, then selected alternating notes.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-move-notes.png" NAME="Graphic89" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=304 HEIGHT=269 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">Then I dragged the center
note and dropped it in the next staff down, right over the bar line.
The remaining notes took their places on either side of it.</P>
<P ALIGN=RIGHT><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-move-notes1.png" NAME="Graphic90" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=304 HEIGHT=279 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium"><I>TIP: I find that I have
a tendency to surprise myself with this feature. It is not necessary
to select an element before dragging it, and neither is it a
requirement that you only move a note from your selection. If you
have a selection off to the side somewhere, it is very easy to forget
that it is going to move too. When you perform the actual drag
operation, there is no visual indication that the selected notes are
going along for the ride. If the selection is not visible, you might
not even notice what has happened until some time after performing
the drag. This is not a bug, but it often feels like one. I have
stubbed my toe on this innumerable times.</I></P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Ties</H4>
<P>Ties work just like slurs, except that they must occur between two
notes of the same pitch. If you attempt to tie two notes at different
pitches, this will fail silently. No tie will appear, although the
first note will actually have a &quot;tied forward&quot; property,
and if you subsequently drag it in line with another note, the
invisible tie will spring to life. This can be a source of confusion
if you forget what you did.</P>

like this appears:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-text-tool.png" NAME="Graphic84" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=228 HEIGHT=202 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Since we are inserting a dynamic here, we'll use the

one inserted on the rest after the last E) the hairpin shrinks up a
bit to accommodate these, and the result looks like this:</P>

<H4 CLASS="western">Lyrics</H4>
<P>At their heart, lyrics are just text events of type &quot;Lyric,&quot;
and you can add them one by one in this fashion if you wish.
Rosegarden also provides a simple lyric editor that allows you to
write down all the lyrics for a segment in one place.</P>
<H5 CLASS="western">The Lyric Editor</H5>
<P>Start with a segment that has some notation to which you wish to
add lyrics, then open the lyric editor via <B>View -&gt; Open Lyric
Editor</B>. You will see something a bit like this:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-lyric-editor.png" NAME="Graphic87" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=456 HEIGHT=256 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">Rather than reinvent the
wheel, here is what the Rosegarden Handbook has to say about the
lyric editor:</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.49in; font-weight: medium"><I>The
lyrics you enter should follow a particular format. Bar lines are
vital to avoid the editor getting confused, and are represented with
a slash (&quot;/&quot;). Within each bar the individual syllables are
separated by spaces (at least one space: the editor doesn't care
about any extra whitespace). Each syllable in turn will be attached
to the next subsequent note or chord within that bar (although at the
moment the editor can get quite confused by chords that are not
exact, i.e. that require smoothing or quantizing).</I></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.49in; font-weight: medium"><I>If
you want a note to have no syllable attached to it, you need to
provide a dot (&quot;.&quot;) as the syllable for that note. (This is
why the default lyric text for a segment is usually full of dots.)
Remember to separate the dots with spaces, so that they are clearly
separate syllables.</I></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.49in; font-weight: medium"><I>If
you want more than one syllable on the same note, with a space
between them, use a tilde (&quot;~&quot;) instead of the space. It
will be shown as a space on the score.</I></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.49in; font-weight: medium"><I>If
you want to split a syllable across two notes, with a hyphen, you
need to enter a space following the hyphen so the editor knows to
treat it as two syllables. (Hyphens get no special treatment within
syllables.)</I></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.49in; font-weight: medium"><I>Syllables
consisting only of numbers surrounded by square brackets (like
&quot;[29]&quot;) will be ignored; this is the format used for the
automatically-generated bar numbers shown in the editor.</I></P>

<H2 CLASS="western">Legible Notation from Performance Data</H2>
<P>You should have a solid understanding how the notation editor
works by now, but there are a number of more complicated issues I
have held back along the way, and reserved until now. The largest
challenge most people face in using the notation editor is making
good looking notation out of a MIDI recording or an imported MIDI
file. Good performances almost always make for notation that is
almost impossible to read. Human beings rarely play notes exactly on
the beat boundaries, and unless a slur or tenuto is involved, notes
are seldom held for their full written duration. A notation editor
that draws notes with mechanical precision will render such a
performance as a completely insane mess full of bizarre short notes,
punctuating a sea of bizarre, short rests.</P>
<P>Here is a MIDI file imported with no quantization. Most of the bar
lines are red, indicating that the events inside the measure do not
fit correctly, and that the measure contains too many beats.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-quantizer1.png" NAME="Graphic110" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=380 HEIGHT=43 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Here is the same file after a reasonable notation
quantization has been done. It still has problems, but it requires
much less manual intervention than the original.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">The Quantizer</H3>
<P>Rosegarden's quantizer can be quite a complicated animal to
understand. &quot;Quantization&quot; is the process of combing
through a series of note events, comparing their start times and
durations to logical beat boundaries on a grid, and nudging them
around to tidy them up. It can move early or late notes back on
center, it can stretch or squash notes that are too long or too short
into a more logical and legible pattern. It is particularly useful
for rendering readable notation from an imperfect human performance,
and, as I have mentioned, it can perform these operations on the
visible notation, leaving the original human performance untouched.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Triggered Segments and Ornaments</H3>
<P>Another way that Rosegarden lets you have your cake and eat it too
is in its ability to make use of triggered segments to provide
ornaments. The ornament is stored in a special segment apart from the
main body of the composition, and is triggered by a special trigger
note that can have marks indicating the type of ornament represented
by the triggered segment. These ornaments can be recycled as well,
because it is possible to have more than one trigger note pointing to
the same triggered segment.</P>
<P>One place where this is particularly useful is when trying to
clean up a nice MIDI performance in order to produce a readable score
from it. My test score has ornaments that really can't be used
directly if I want to reproduce the score exactly, so I will kill two
birds with one stone here, demonstrating how to replace a bunch of
ugly gibberish with an ornament made from scratch. Unfortunately,
yes, this will alter the human performance somewhat, so there is some
compromise here between an authentic performance and an exact score.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Before</H4>
<P>This is a typical example of an ornament in an imported MIDI file.
The quantizer really can't really do much to improve the look of
this, and it would be awkward to read even if all the short notes
were written out neatly. It is a prime candidate for conversion into
a triggered segment and a trigger note.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-trigger1.png" NAME="Graphic96" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=380 HEIGHT=234 BORDER=0></P>
<H4 CLASS="western">The First Try</H4>
<P>To start, I needed to change the first 8<SUP>th</SUP> note into a
dotted version. I accomplished this by selecting it, and using <B>Ctrl</B>+<B>.</B>
and then I selected the body of the ornament...</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-trigger2.png" NAME="Graphic97" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=380 HEIGHT=78 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>Next, I used <B>Notes -&gt; Ornaments -&gt; Make
Ornament</B>, which presented the following dialog. Since this
ornament is a trill up from E to F, I chose E as the base note. I
left the suggested name at its default.<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-trigger3.png" NAME="Graphic98" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=222 BORDER=0></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: medium">The resulting
ornament wasn't quite what I was after. There were several distinct
notes with fairly long durations bound up in that jumble, which
couldn't readily be extracted. I could have set the ornament to play
in a shorter duration by selecting this trigger note and changing it
to a dotted 8<SUP>th</SUP> note, and could have added extra notes to
make up the difference on the page, but those extra notes would have
been extra. I wanted to preserve the accuracy of the performance
while cleaning up this trill, and this didn't quite work in this
case...</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-trigger4.png" NAME="Graphic99" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=380 HEIGHT=72 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">...so I hit undo (<B>Ctrl</B>+<B>Z</B>)
until I got back to the point before making the ornament, and then I
re-selected the events, and then deleted them (<B>Ctrl</B>+<B>X</B>).</P>

<H4 CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium">The Second Try</H4>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Next, I inserted the untrilled notes
that were bound up with that ornament, and left a rest where the new
ornament needed to go...</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-trigger6.png" NAME="Graphic101" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=380 HEIGHT=73 BORDER=0></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Then I notated a trill using 32<SUP>nd</SUP>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">...and used <B>Notes -&gt;
Ornaments -&gt; Make Ornament</B> again, then I followed up by
beaming the trigger note to the note after it, and adding a <I>tr</I>
with a wavy line. (The wavy line was not actually part of the
original score if there are any purists in the audience. You got me.)

of the work for me automagically.</P>
