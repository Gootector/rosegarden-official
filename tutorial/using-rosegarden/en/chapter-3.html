 Let's begin by starting Rosegarden, and having a look at the main
 window. This is where you get an overall view of your work, and control
 a number of settings and parameters.</P>
<H2>3.1 <A NAME="2_1"></A>The Main Window</H2>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
 A Rosegarden document is called a composition. The main window is
 primarily dedicated to editing at the composition level, so most of
 these tools affect your document in a broad way. This is where you name
 tracks and assign instruments to them, create and manipulate segments,
 and watch a broad overview of playback. (I will explain these concepts
 in more detail later on.) This is also where you configure segment
 parameters such as label and color. Tempo and time signature settings
 exist a composition level, and they may be edited here in the main
 window using the tempo ruler.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">One of the
 first things you might notice about Rosegarden is that there are
 several toolbars at the top of the main window. In addition to the

 there are several toolbars specific to Rosegarden. You'll choose
 various tools for selecting and manipulating segments from the Tools

<H2><A NAME="3_3">3.3 The Tracklist</A></H2>
<P>Rosegarden is a track-based sequencer. Each entry in the tracklist is
 a separate track that can have individualized settings for several
 different parameters. Each track has a label and an output assignment,
 and can be used to record, play, and manipulate either MIDI or audio
 data, but never both.</P>
<H3><A NAME="3_3_1">3.3.1 Instrument vs. Name</A></H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The tracklist can be configured to
 display either the name you've assigned to the track, or the name of
 the instrument to which it is connected. Toggle this behavior with<B>

 on, in<A HREF="../en/chapter-4.html#5 Managing Instruments (under construction)|outline">

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Here we see how instrument assignments

 compositions are made up of<B> segments</B>, and editing at the
 composition level involves dragging them around and rearranging them
 within tracks. Segments are a universal container that may hold either
 MIDI events or audio data. Segments are rather similar to layers in an
 image editing program such as the GIMP. They can be cut, pasted, split,
 re-combined, overlapped and pretty much rearranged at will, and are
 very flexible. While there are, understandably, some differences in the
 way audio and MIDI segments behave, they can be manipulated in almost
 exactly the same way within the composition. The only real limitation
 is that audio segments and MIDI segments cannot both play in the same
 track.</P>

 Highlighting the smaller of two overlapping segments can sometimes be a

 in an image editing program.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">
 This can also merge MIDI events from several different tracks into a

 whichever track is currently active.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">
 Audio segments can be split and resized, but they cannot be joined or
 merged. If you split an audio segment, you can undo that operation to
 revert it to its original state, but you cannot, for example, cut out
 the middle and splice the ends back together. Neither can you merge two
 overlapping audio segments into one, nor merge audio and MIDI segments
 together.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">
 If you have a segment where the treble and bass parts are jumbled
 together, you might wish to split this at middle C or thereabouts. You
 can use<B> Segments -&gt; Split and Join -&gt; Split by Pitch</B> and then
 make your selections for split point, clef handling, etc. from the
 resulting dialog. By default, this feature attempts to split the
 segment intelligently, so that you can hopefully avoid winding up with
 treble notes in the bass part, and bass notes in the treble part.</P>

 <IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic8" SRC="../pixmaps/main-split-by-pitch.png"

<P>Once split, the two segments will overlap exactly on the same track.
 It is impossible to select a segment that lies completely underneath
 another segment, so it is probably a good idea to move one of the two
 halves into a different track.</P>

 Every segment can have a unique label and color. In this example, I've
 chosen the most obvious color to use for this French horn part, but

 the Studio chapter.</P>
<H3><A NAME="3_4_6">3.4.6 Repeats</A></H3>

 desired resolution. It will not change note durations in any way.</P>
<H3><A NAME="3_4_8">3.4.8 Transposing Instruments</A></H3>
<P>If you wish to write notation for transposing instruments, you can
 dial a transposition setting into the<B> Transpose</B> box. This will
 cause the part to sound in a different range from written. A typical Bb
 trumpet part, for example, should have -2 here. I'll cover this subject
 in more depth later on, in the Notation chapter.</P>
<H3><A NAME="3_4_9">3.4.9 Delay</A></H3>
<P>The<B> Delay</B> setting allows you to knock the timing of a segment

 especially amusing for transforming a nicely performed MIDI file into a
 simulation of a middle school band concert.</P>

 I'll conclude this section by mentioning a very useful feature that
 doesn't quite fit in anywhere else. As always, &quot;save early, save often&quot;
 is the mantra of computer users everywhere, and can't be stressed
 enough. It's never a bad idea to take time out to save your work.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
 However, Rosegarden attempts to save you from yourself.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
 If you have a power outage or the like, the next time you start
 Rosegarden and attempt to load the file you were working on, you'll be
 presented with the option of loading the autosave file instead. If you
 hadn't yet saved the file, you'll find it in your ~/autosave directory
 with a basic name of &quot;untitled.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">

<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->
 The autosave interval defaults to 60 seconds. Configure it via the
 Settings menu. If you notice Rosegarden grabbing a lot of your CPU time
 for no apparent reason, it's probably autosave, and you might want to
 increase the interval, or turn this feature completely off. It was
 frankly more useful when Rosegarden was young, and unstable.</P>
