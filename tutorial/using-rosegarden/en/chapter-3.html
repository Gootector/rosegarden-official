<H1><A NAME="3">3 The Studio</A></H1>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">Now that you
 have a general idea how Rosegarden works, now is a good time to think
 about telling Rosegarden where it needs to send data in order to get
 your computer to make some noise.</P>
<H2><A NAME="3_1">3.1 What is a &quot;studio&quot;?</A></H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Every native Rosegarden composition
 (.rg) file contains a studio definition in addition to note events,
 pointers to audio samples, and any other data. This studio definition
 is a description of your MIDI landscape, and it provides a mechanism
 for routing MIDI events to and from your various input and output
 devices, as well as providing a facility for you to describe what sort
 of programs and controllers are available for your use with each
 device. The idea is that once you have properly configured your studio
 it will be very easy to control all of your equipment by referring to
 it by name, rather than some obscure number.</P>
<H3><A NAME="3_1_1">3.1.1 What is a &quot;device&quot;?</A></H3>
<P>A &quot;device&quot; is a layer of abstraction that encapsulates information
 about your MIDI gear and allows you to control it conveniently from
 Rosegarden. A &quot;device&quot; might be a MIDI keyboard connected to your
 computer, or an ALSA soft synth like Hydrogen. When you define a
 &quot;device&quot; you can give it a convenient name, and can tell Rosegarden
 which programs and controllers are available for use with that
 particular piece of equipment.</P>
<H3><A NAME="3_1_2">3.1.2 autoload.rg</A></H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Unlike some other packages, Rosegarden
 has no single place where you can configure all of this sort of thing
 and have that configuration remain unchanged between different
 compositions you might load into it. If you start Rosegarden with no
 file to open, it opens a default blank document, called<B> autoload.rg</B>
. Initially, this will be the system default that was installed with
 Rosegarden. You create a local copy in your ~/.kde after modifying the
 studio in the active document, and saving the current document as your
 new default studio (as I will describe shortly.) I feel that it's very
 important to point this out before you even get started configuring
 your studio, because you should realize that only documents you create<I>
 after</I> modifying your<B> autoload.rg</B> will take your new
 settings. If you load an old document, or a document someone created in
 a different studio environment, you will probably have to manually
 adjust it to your current landscape.</P>
<H2>3.2 <A NAME="2_5_2"></A>Configuring MIDI Connections</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">The first
 step in configuring your studio is to set up connections to your MIDI
 devices via<B> Composition -&gt; Studio -&gt; Manage MIDI Devices...</B></P>
<P>You'll be presented with a dialog that resembles this one, except, of
 course, that this one has already been configured to suit my own
 default studio. It is divided into two sections, for play and record
 devices, and it shows you how each of these &quot;devices&quot; is connected to
 internal, external, and soft synths. In this example, I have a device
 named &quot;Roland SC-33&quot; connected to &quot;64:0 EMU101K MPU-401 (UART)
 (duplex)&quot; and four &quot;SB Live (?)&quot; devices connected to each of 65:0
 through 65:3, which are the four output ports on my SB Live!. I also
 have three generic spots reserved for soft synths, named &quot;Soft Synth 1&quot;
 through &quot;Soft Synth 3&quot;, one of which is currently connected to KAMix,
 an ALSA mixer client that can be controlled via MIDI.</P>

<H3><A NAME="3_2_1">3.2.1 ALSA Ports</A></H3>
<P>You might wonder about the strange numbers you see in front of you.
 ALSA assigns ports in three ranges. 64: means it is an external MIDI
 port, which might be connected to a MIDI keyboard, sound module, or
 other noise producing gadget through some sort of cable. 65: means it
 is an internal MIDI port, such as the on-board synth on the SB Live!
 and its cousins. ALSA soft synths like Hydrogen, ZynAddSubFX and the
 like will take numbers at the time they're started, on a first-come,
 first served basis starting at 128:</P>
<P>You may wonder why I don't seem to have a 128:0 or 129:0 in the
 preceding example. If you want to have a look at the whole picture of
 what ALSA ports are available, you can run<B> pmidi -l</B>
<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->
 to list all
 of your available ports. Here are mine:</P>

<H3><A NAME="3_2_2">3.2.2 Record Devices</A></H3>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
 Record devices are MIDI keyboards, virtual keyboards, MIDI guitars and
 the like. As record devices are rather less complicated, I will mention
 them first. If you have one or more ports capable of recording, you may
 name and assign connections in the<B> Record devices</B> section of
 this dialog. Rosegarden cannot yet manage multiple simultaneous MIDI
 inputs. If you have more than one, you will need to mark one of them as
 [x] Current. This device will be used for all MIDI recording operations
 until you specify otherwise by coming back to this dialog.</P>
<H3><A NAME="3_2_3">3.2.3 <B>Play Devices</B></A></H3>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
 Play devices are where all the fun, and all the complexity is. They can
 be MIDI keyboards, sound modules, ALSA soft synths, samplers, and
 pretty well anything else that can take MIDI input, such as KAMix.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
 In order to control your MIDI landscape conveniently from Rosegarden,
 you probably want to manage not only the connections, but the &quot;devices&quot;
 themselves. Remember, a &quot;device&quot; is more than a name, but also a
 container for information about the capabilities of the MIDI equipment
 it represents.</P>
<P>Let us assume for example you have a Roland SC-33 hooked up to your
 computer. It can receive on 16 channels, and it is capable of playing
 your notes using any of 300-odd instruments. It responds to several
 different controllers. In order to control these features from
 Rosegarden, you must tell Rosegarden about them. For your own
 convenience, you probably want to replace Rosegarden's default
 &quot;Anonymous MIDI Device&quot; type name with something more meaningful.</P>
<H2><A NAME="3_3">3.3 Telling Rosegarden About a Device</A></H2>
<P>You might want to begin by giving your device a better name. Simply
 double click on the existing name and type a new one.</P>
<H3>3.3.1 <A NAME="2_5_3"></A>Loading An Instrument Definition</H3>
<P>Now that your &quot;Anonymous External Device&quot; has become a &quot;Roland SC-33&quot;
 or what have you, you probably want to
<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->
 load or create some instrument
 definitions for it. Depending on the capabilities of this device, it
 might not matter whether you define named program changes or not, but
 if you do intend to transmit program changes to the device, you need to
 define<I> something</I> here. Rosegarden has a bit of a double-edged
 feature in that any program (and controller) numbers that don't have a
 name assigned to them are ignored during MIDI import, and they are
 filtered out of your sight when assigning instruments to tracks. This
 can be very convenient with something like a GS synth, where there are
 many banks that have only a smattering of randomly scattered programs
 available. Instead of wading through a lot of nothing, you can dial up
 exactly what's useful to you. On the other hand, it does make your job
 more complicated if all you want to do is transmit arbitrary program
 and bank change numbers as you see fit. In order to do so, you must
 assign<I> something</I> to those numbers you wish to be able to
 transmit before they will become available to you.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">

 The first level of the tree is the selected device. The branches of the
 tree point to banks, each of which can contain instrument definitions
 for program changes numbered 1-128. MIDI uses two parameters, called
 MSB and LSB (Most/Least Significant Byte), to change banks, and their
 implementation is device-dependent. Some synths do bank changes on MSB,
 some on LSB, and some use both in combination.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
 If you're lucky, the growing Rosegarden Library already contains a set
 of bank and program definitions to suit your hardware. To load a
 ready-made instrument definition, use the<B> Import Banks</B> button.</P>

 list of<B> .rgd</B> files from which to choose. By default, you'll be
 presented with selections from the Library, which was installed along
 with Rosegarden itself, but you can, of course, browse to other
 locations. You can import banks from both<B> .rg</B> and<B> .rgd</B>
 files. The studio contained within both types of files is functionally
 identical, and<B> .rgd</B> files are offered only as a logical
 convenience.</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
 If you're using a synth that makes use of<B> .sf2</B> format sound
 fonts (such as QSynth or the SB Live! series of soundcards), you can
 import the program names directly out of the soundfont by navigating to
 the<B> .sf2</B> file and selecting it as the source for the import of
 banks.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">Typically,<B>
 .rgd</B> files will contain only one set of bank and program
 definitions, so there should only be one &quot;Source device&quot; to load. If
 you're loading an<B> .rg</B> file or a non-standard<B> .rgd</B>, which
 contains multiple sets of bank definitions, then you may select which
 one of them to load into this slot. If you've chosen an<B> .sf2</B>
 file, then you shouldn't have a choice to make here.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
 Regardless of the source of the banks, you'll be given a choice to
 merge the new program defintions into your existing definition, which
 will only fill in slots that are currently empty, or to erase
 everything that's there and replace it completely with the contents of
 the imported file.</P>
<H2>3.4 <A NAME="2_5_4"></A>Creating A Custom Instrument Definition</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
 If none of the bank definitions in the library fit, and you can't load
 the program names out of a soundfont, you can use an existing file from
 the library as a starting point, or you can create a new instrument
 definition completely from scratch.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
 Taking the example of my Roland SC-33, I looked at the implementation
 chart in the back of the manual, and then decided how I wanted to
 arrange the banks. Since the LSB/MSB address of the bank is what makes
 it unique, and they can actually all have identical names, I had to
 give some real thought to the best way to organize my available patches
 in order to make getting to what I wanted to find as simple and logical
 as possible.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
 I tried to come up with names for the banks that roughly reflect what
 sort of variations are available in each one, though it's somewhat
 imperfect because Roland wasn't very orderly in deciding what to put
 where, and there are some few melodic instruments in banks that are
 normally only used for sound effects. Depending on your hardware, you,
 too, may face similar compromises.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
 Once you've decided what your instrument definition needs to contain,
 and how it should be organized, entering your data is a straightforward
 matter. Use the<B> Add Bank</B> and<B> Delete Bank</B> or<B> Delete All
 Banks</B> buttons as necessary to pave the way, then start filling out
 the dialog box. If you have similar sets of program changes in two
 different banks, you can copy one from the other using<B> Copy Programs</B>
 and<B> Paste Programs</B> to save yourself some typing.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
 If you don't enter a string for a particular program number, you won't
 have to scroll through that slot when choosing an instrument later on.
 This is very convenient if you have a bank that only contains a few
 available programs, as there is no need to scroll through a lot of
 useless entries on your way to the few slots that actually do
 something. This is especially useful for some of my Roland banks that
 only have a few program changes that are widely scattered.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
 Finally, you may have noticed that Rosegarden only allows you one set
 of program changes per LSB/MSB combination. The exception to this rule
 is that you may define a parallel set of program changes if the [x]
 Percussion box is checked. For example, if you have a synth that
 interprets standard program changes in bank LSB 0 MSB 0 on channel 10
 as drum kit changes (like GS) then you can click on<B> Add</B>, then
 check the [x] Percussion box, dial the LSB and MSB values back to 0 (or
 wherever they need to be for your implementation) and enter the names
 of drum kits as programs.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
 Finally, now that you're this far, what do you do if you merely wish to
 be able to transmit arbitrary program and bank numbers without naming
 them? As of this release, your best bet is probably to begin by
 importing<B> raw-numbers.rgd</B> into any banks (LSB/MSB combinations)
 you wish to be able to transmit.. That will populate the program dialog
 with numbers, and might offer you a suitable compromise.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
 Once you've defined the names for your program changes, you can save
 the definition to disk with<B> Export Banks</B>.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">If you think
 anyone else might benefit from having the instrument definition, you
 can mail it to me at<A HREF="mailto:mmcintyr@swva.net"><B>
 dmmcintyr@users.sourceforge.net</B></A> and I will add it to our
 growing collection of user contributions.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->
New
 contributions are most welcome. We pioneers must do all the work so
 that future generations can be lazy. Just remember that I had to do the
 SC-33 device from scratch too, and it was very tedious and
 time-consuming. Especially since this stuff was a lot more buggy and
 incomprehensible back then. ;)</P>
<H2><A NAME="3_5">3.5 Soft Synth Caveats</A></H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; font-weight: medium">If you run a
 variety of soft synths and you wish to create named connections for
 them, you can run into a bit of trouble. Remember that ALSA port
 numbers are allocated on a first come, first serve basis as you start
 the softsynths, and Rosegarden only concerns itself with the<I> number</I>
. That means it's very easy to get your named Rosegarden device names
 out of sync with where the notes are actually going unless you take
 care to start your softsynths in the same order every time. It's a
 simple matter to rearrange this when they do get out of sync, but I
 find myself coming back to this connection dialog more often than I
 would like.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
 If you wish to reserve a name for a softsynth or other type of device
 that you don't currently have running, you can create an empty slot at
 will using the New button, and you can delete anything you wish using
 the Delete button. Alternatively, Rosegarden will automatically detect
 any new ALSA ports that become available, so you can create a new entry
 for, say, QSynth (FluidSynth) merely by starting it. A new entry will
 appear in the dialog before your very eyes.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
<I> REMEMBER: These empty slots are given default connections in the
 order that new connections become known to Rosegarden. If you start
 softsynths in a different order at a later date, or you have only one
 or two of them running, you will surely need to come back to this
 dialog and rearrange your connections in order for your named ports to
 have useful meaning. For example, as I write this, I have to assign
 tracks to the port called Hydrogen in order for QSynth to play, because
 I started QSynth after Hydrogen, and I have them the other way around
 in my studio. Hopefully Rosegarden can better come to grips with this
 scenario some day.</I></P>
<H2><A NAME="3_6">3.6 Custom Controllers</A></H2>
<P>Rosegarden should create a few basic default controllers for you. If
 you have special requirements, or if some of these controllers don't

 default, this is ~/rosegarden. If this path doesn't exist, you won't be
 able to record audio, so either create that directory or configure
 Rosegarden to look somewhere else here.</P>
