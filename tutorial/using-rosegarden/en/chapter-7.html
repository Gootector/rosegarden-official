 Different View (needs final edit)</FONT></A></H1>
<P STYLE="border: none; padding: 0in">So far, we've only looked at the
 main window, and have not really edited anything. Rosegarden provides
 three different editors, each with its own unique view of the data. You
 can view the raw Rosegarden events with the Event List Editor, you can
 work with a piano roll metaphor with the matrix Editor, or you can see
 your data as notation with the Notation Editor. Each of these editors
 works on a segment level, so you must have at least one segment
 selected in order to open one. If you wish to start with an editor from
 scratch, you must first create an empty segment with the pencil tool,
 as I described in chapter 2, and then select it.</P>

<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="7_1_1">7.1.1 Events and Properties</A></H3>
<P>Rosegarden is not a pure MIDI sequencer, and it does not store raw
 MIDI events; instead, it uses its own internal format, which is both
 more powerful and more flexible. There are many kinds of events in
 Rosegarden. As you would expect, MIDI notes, controllers and the like
 are events, but so are hairpins, dynamics, performance directions,
 clefs and key signatures, etc. Each class of event has its own set of
 unique properties.</P>
<P>Here are just a few examples of types of events with a few their
 properties. All of these can be edited from here in the event list
 editor, although you probably will find little occasion to tear an
 event apart and rearrange its insides.</P>

<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="7_1_2">7.1.2 Example Uses</A></H3>
<P>I have elected to demonstrate only those uses which I judge are most
 difficult for you to figure out on your own. While I am only covering a
 select few types of events, the process for creating (or changing) all
 of them is similar.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western"><A NAME="7_1_2_1">7.1.2.1 Inserting a
 Mid-Composition Program Change</A></H4>
<P>One thing that can only be done from the event editor is the
 insertion of a mid-track program change. This might be useful, for
 example, if you wish to switch a string part from playing normally to
 playing pizzicato and back without having to write the parts on
 different tracks to assign them to different instruments.</P>
<P>In version 1.0 of Rosegarden, the facility for entering program
 changes is rather crude and unwieldy. It may see improvement in future
 versions, but for the moment, the only mechanism provided is the entry
 of program changes by number. There is no facility for changing the
 bank anywhere except at the instrument level, so any program changes
 you insert directly into segments will be done within the same bank the
 track's instrument uses.</P>
<P>If you want to change a &quot;strings&quot; instrument to play using a
 &quot;pizzicato&quot; program at a particular point...</P>
<H5 CLASS="western"><A NAME="7_1_2_1_1">7.1.2.1.1 Determine the
 Insertion Point</A></H5>
<P>The easiest thing to do is move the playback pointer to the desired
 insertion point. In this example, I've done it using the transport in
 beat:bar mode to ensure I'm in exactly the desired spot to insert a
 program change at bar 2, beat 1, tick 0.</P>
<P>Remember that the <IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic30"
SRC="../pixmaps/transport-switch-modes.png" > button changes display
 modes on the transport.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic26"

<H5 CLASS="western"><A NAME="7_1_2_1_2">7.1.2.1.2 Open the Editor,
 Create an Event</A></H5>
<P>If you right click on this segment and choose to open it in the event
 list view, your cursor should already be at the right spot to insert a
 program change at the desired time. In this sample, there happens to
 already be a note at that particular time, but that will not prevent
 you from inserting a program change event here at the same time. In
 fact, if you are inserting a program change into otherwise empty space,
 you will have to set its time manually.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic27"

<P>Click on the <IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic28"

 The dialog will open out to a default event type of &quot;note.&quot; You want to
 dial &quot;programchange&quot; into the &quot;Event type&quot; combo box to make this event
 into a program change.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic29"

<H5 CLASS="western"><A NAME="7_1_2_1_3">7.1.2.1.3 Create the Program
 Change</A></H5>
<P>Now you should have a dialog like this. Except, of course, I have
 already twiddled the settings in this particular example.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic32"
SRC="../pixmaps/event-list-new-program.png" ></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Now you need to dial in the program change by number.
 Unlike the numbers used elsewhere in Rosegarden (which appear out
 beside the name when changing programs in the<B> Instrument Parameters</B>
 box, for example), these are zero-based, rather than one-based. If the
 program &quot;Acoustic Grand Piano&quot; shows up as program 1 in your studio,
 you'll have to subtract one from that and use 0. I've included a
 zero-based list of General MIDI program numbers in<A HREF="../chapter-100.html">
 Appendix C</A> for your convenience. In this case, &quot;Pizzicato&quot; is
 program number 45.</P>
<H5 CLASS="western"><A NAME="7_1_2_1_4">7.1.2.1.4 Changing an Event Time</A>
</H5>
<P>You may have some occasion to change the time of the event.</P>
<P>Click on the <IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic31"
SRC="../pixmaps/dot-dot-dot-button.png" > button out beside &quot;Absolute
 time&quot; and you will be presented with a dialog that allows you to
 re-assert the fact that you want this event at 2:1:0. You'll need to
 dial in the Measure (2) beat (1) and 64ths (0) to get the event to come
 in at the desire time. If this does become necessary, at least you
 already know what time to aim for, having used the playback pointer and
 transport to get the &quot;address&quot; of this particular moment in time.</P>

<H4 CLASS="western"><A NAME="7_1_2_2">7.1.2.2 Managing System Exclusive
 Data</A></H4>
<P>I don't have time to do a proper job of discussing this rather
 involved and arcane subject at the moment, and I may remove this before
 publishing the final draft of this book. In the meantime, here is a
 message from Pedro Lopez Cabanillas, author of most of these features,
 on the subject of sysex in Rosegarden:</P>
<P>&gt; Would you mind giving me a rundown?</P>
<P>About your question: System Exclusive messages can be recorded,
 played, exported to Standard MIDI Files and imported from them as any
 other MIDI event. It's not worth to mention that, IMO, as that's what
 everybody expects from a MIDI sequencer. But you know that was a hard
 way to reach this place.</P>
<P>You need to use the Event List editor for any editing on System
 Exclusive events.</P>
<P>To create a new SysEx event from scratch:</P>
<OL>
<LI>
<P>insert Event (star button, or menu Edit-&gt;insert event)</P>
</LI>
<LI>
<P>select &quot;systemexclusive&quot; in the event type combo.</P>
</LI>
</OL>
<P>3. fill the &quot;Data&quot; field, write some Hex values starting with &quot;F0&quot;
 and ending with &quot;F7&quot;. Alternatively, you can use the &quot;Load Data&quot; button
 to import the payload from a &quot;SYX&quot; file.</P>
<P>The load function only imports the first sysex block from the file,
 if there is more than one. SYX Files created with Cakewalk can be
 loaded into RG.</P>
<P>Use the &quot;Save Data&quot; button to store the payload of an existing SysEx
 event into an external &quot;SYX&quot; file.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="7_2">7.2 The Matrix Editor</A></H2>
<P>The matrix editor is based around the familiar piano roll metaphor
 you have probably seen in other packages. It is useful for taking a
 hands on approach to tweaking notes where their performance is more
 important than their visual appearance as notation. The matrix is my
 preferred method of sequencing percussion parts, and I use it whenever
 the notation editor is simply unable to cope with my data, and needs a
 bit of a brute force shove to get things to come out right. There
 hasn't been a quantizer written yet that can make consistently good
 decisions in the face of the kind of mistakes I tend to make while
 playing my keyboard, and I spend quite a lot of time flipping back and
 forth between matrix and notation views.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="7_2_1">7.2.1 Special Considerations of
 Performance vs. Display</A></H3>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">It is important to note that Rosegarden is
 not purely a MIDI sequencer, and at no time can you ever directly edit
 raw MIDI events. It stores events using an internal meta format that
 includes quite a bit of information about each note. Rosegarden's
 events do of course cover the fundamentals of pitch, velocity and
 duration, but they also include such attributes as stem direction, beam
 state, accidental state, ties, slurs, slashes, accents and so forth. Of
 special note, every Rosegarden event maintains independent duration
 values for performance and display. This makes it possible to create a
 composition that looks good printed on paper, and yet preserves all of
 the slight human imperfections that give a performance its character.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">In version 1.0, the matrix can only edit<B>
 performance</B> attributes. This can create interesting challenges both
 for performance and notation. If you are working on a human
 performance, and you draw notes to their full length here in the
 matrix, you may damage the character of the performance slightly. On
 the other hand, if you draw slightly long or short notes here, or knock
 the timing off the grid lines intentionally, you will create ugly
 notation in the process. In either case, you can make adjustments to
 massage away these differences from the Notation Editor, as I will
 explain in the next chapter.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">One particularly
 noteworthy side effect of the way Rosegarden stores events is that tied
 notes are a series of discrete dashes here on the matrix. It is really
 not possible to determine whether a series of notes at the same pitch
 will sound as one note or several without looking at the affected area
 from the Notation Editor.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="7_2_2">7.2.2 Overview</A></H3>
<P>Let's start with an empty segment one measure long, and I'll show you
 the basics. Draw your segment, select it, and then right click on it
 and choose &quot;Open in Matrix Editor&quot; from the resulting context menu.
 You'll see something like this:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic4"
SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-overview.png" ></P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="7_3">7.3 The Local Cursor</A></H2>
<P>I will go into more detail about the local cursor in the notation
 chapter, but it does have its uses here in the matrix as well. If you
 take a second look at the rulers, you should see that the one toward
 the top of the screen has a magenta cast. This ruler is for controlling
 the local cursor, which is a magenta version of the playback pointer.
 You can set it in the same fashion you set the playback pointer, and
 the two cursors function independently of each other. The local
 cursor's main function here in the matrix seems to be to set the
 destination location for paste operations.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic51"
SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-two-cursors.png" ></P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="7_3_1">7.3.1 Entering New Notes</A></H3>
<P>Now let's do a little one bar loop for demonstration purposes. Just
 like on the main view, the <IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic65"
SRC="../pixmaps/using-rosegarden_html_4c452e31.png" > cursor is used to
 create something new from scratch. In this case, of course, we're
 entering a note. Let's pepper this thing with a few well placed random
 pitches:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic5"
SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-new-notes.png" ></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">You may have noticed that those came out as quarter
 notes. In order to control the default length of new notes, you must
 change the grid setting. Let's enter eight 8<SUP>th</SUP> notes. First
 dial in the 8<SUP>th</SUP> note on the grid button:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic6"
SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-dial-grid.png" ></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Now new notes you enter will take this duration by
 default:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic7"
SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-8th-notes.png" ></P>
<P>It's obviously a bit tedious, but you can enter an entire composition
 this way if you desire.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="7_3_2">7.3.2 Adjusting Existing Notes</A></H3>
<P>You can move notes around with the <IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic8" SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-move-cursor.png" > cursor.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic9"
SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-move-notes.png" ></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">You can resize notes with the <IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
NAME="Graphic11" SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-resize-cursor.png" >
 cursor, by clicking on a note and dragging it.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic10"
SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-resize-notes.png" ></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">By default, resize operations snap to grid lines. If you
 wish to drag the note to some arbitrary length, do so by holding the
 shift key while dragging the note.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic12"
SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-arbitrary-resize.png" ></P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="7_3_3">7.3.3 Selecting and Acting on
 Multiple Notes</A></H3>
<P>All of these operations can be performed on more than one note at a
 time. In order to do so, you need to make a selection. You can use the <IMG
ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic13" SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-arrow-cursor.png"
> cursor to select individual notes one by one while holding
 down the shift key.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic14"
SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-select-individual-notes.png" ></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">If you wish to select a broad range of notes, you can
 select every note of a given pitch by selecting the arrow cursor and
 shift clicking on the individual notes on the piano keyboard. Each
 click will select every note of the desired pitch, and you can select
 any number of pitches in this fashion.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic15"
SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-select-pitch.png" ></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">It is also possible to select a band or several bands of
 notes by sweeping the arrow cursor across the keys while holding shift.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic16"
SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-sweep-selection.png" ></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Finally, if you have some need to select ranges of notes
 within an area less than the entire segment, you can use the selection
 event filter. Start by making a broad selection, and then click on the
 filter icon to summon the dialog. You can then dial in various criteria
 for the notes you wish to remain selected after the filter is applied.
 I'll demonstrate one use for it later on in this chapter.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic17"
SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-event-filter.png" ></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>NOTE: If you ever find a good use for this dialog's
 ability to filter on controller or wheel events, please let me know. I
 implemented this dialog before Rosegarden had control rulers, when the
 only way to get to these outside the event list editor, which didn't
 actually work at that time, was to manipulate them as little question
 marks in the notation view. I'm not convinced these last two event
 categories are actually still useful, and I expect to remove them from
 the dialog for Rosegarden 1.1 unless I get feedback requesting
 otherwise.</I></P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="7_3_4">7.3.4 Velocity</A></H3>
<P>Velocity is a MIDI parameter that describes how hard a note was hit
 on the keyboard or other device. It allows for finer expression of
 volume than what can be accomplished merely by adjusting the volume
 parameter for the MIDI channel. If you have a velocity sensitive
 keyboard, this parameter will be recorded as you play. Under certain
 other circumstances, you may end up with events that have no velocity
 property at all, or a default velocity of 100. Regardless of how it did
 (or didn't) get there, it's a simple matter to tweak it to suit your
 needs.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western"><A NAME="7_3_4_1">7.3.4.1 Showing the Velocity Ruler</A>

FACE="arial">Sequencing a Drum Pattern</FONT></A></H3>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><FONT FACE="arial">I find it rather
 difficult and tedious to do drums with the notation editor for several
 reasons. It does not yet support standard percussion notation, and it
 is yet very well capable of handling multi-voice parts with different
 rhythms in different lines within the same segment. For this reason,
 the matrix is my editor of choice for drum parts.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="arial"><I>NOTE: For more complicated parts, I favor doing
 them with Hydrogen, and then importing the patterns. However, this can
 present special challenges too, as Hydrogen's drum kits rarely map out
 to the General MIDI standard. That leaves me with the hard choice of
 rearranging the patterns to play on my GM and GS equipment, by
 physically moving all the notes to different places, or assigning
 affected tracks to an instrument that's connected to Hydrogen, and
 letting it do the playing. In this last case, there is no way to change
 the drum kit Hydrogen is using without manipulating its GUI, so it
 isn't really possible to save a Rosegarden composition whose Hydrogen
 drums are guaranteed to play correctly without manual user
 intervention. Muddying the waters further, Rosegarden doesn't really
 provide any good , built-in facility for my letting others know what
 they need to go do to Hydrogen in order to play my files. As a result,
 I do tend to do most of my drum work with Rosegarden's admittedly less
 capable facilities, if only for the sake of convenience in distributing
 the results to others.</I></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="arial"><I>NOTE: I'm leaving this mistake in
 for the amusement value. I was about to submit a bug report documenting
 how I created a segment four bars long, opened it in the matrix, and
 could only edit three bars. Can you spot the reason why that happened?

<H4 CLASS="western"><A NAME="7_4_1_2">7.4.1.2 Route the Track to a
 Percussion Instrument</A></H4>
<P>In order to hear drums, you need to route this track to a percussion
 instrument from the main window. If you have General MIDI-compliant
 equipment, all that should be necessary is to route this track to the
 instrument #10 belonging to a suitable device.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic45"
SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-route-sb-live.png" ></P>
<P>In this particular example, I want to use the TR-808 drum kit that's
 part of the soundfont I'm using on my Sound Blaster Live!, so I need to
 dial up bank 1 0 (where the extra drums are) and set the program to &quot;TR
 808.&quot; (Notice that I do not have the<B> [x] Percussion</B> box checked.
 That's because I'm not using a GS device that has drum kits in the same
 0 0 bank as the General MIDI programs. Instead, this device has the
 alternate drum kits in bank 1 0.)</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic46"
SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-pick-tr-808.png" ></P>
<H4 CLASS="western"><A NAME="7_4_1_3">7.4.1.3 Set the Grid and Loop
 Points</A></H4>
<P>Now that the track is routed to play using suitable sounds, head back
 to the matrix window. It's probably a good idea to pick a finer
 resolution than the standard quarter note for the matrix grid. For this
 part, 16<SUP>th</SUP> notes were convenient, so I dialed 1/16<SUP>th</SUP>
 into the<B> Grid</B> combo box.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic48"
SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-grid-16th.png" ></P>
<P>To make it easier to get the pattern right, set the first bar to loop
 using the ruler on the bottom. (Notice that the ruler on top has a
 purplish cast. It's for controlling the local cursor, which I will
 discuss in the notation chapter. The ruler at the bottom is for setting
 loops, and moving the blue playback pointer.)</P>

<H4 CLASS="western"><A NAME="7_4_1_4">7.4.1.4 Sequence the Pattern</A></H4>
<P>The rest is trial and error. Set the main transport window to loop
 mode <IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic49" SRC="../pixmaps/transport-loop.png"
> and hit play. Use the edit tools to insert, remove, and move
 notes until you get a pattern you like. Rosegarden provides no facility
 for labeling which keys play which drums, so you may need to putter
 around a bit before you figure out where they are. This example uses a
 bass, a snare, and a couple of hi-hats, and I have completed my pattern
 in this snapshot.</P>

<H4 CLASS="western"><A NAME="7_4_1_5">7.4.1.5 Copy the Pattern</A></H4>
<P>Select all the event and paste them three times. Use the top ruler to
 set the local cursor to the destination for each paste operation. You
 should wind up with something like this:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic52"
SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-after-copies.png" ></P>
<H4 CLASS="western"><A NAME="7_4_1_6">7.4.1.6 Finish with a Fill</A></H4>
<P>Now set only the last bar to loop, then adjust the pattern to make a
 little fill.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic53"
SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-fill.png" ></P>
<P><I>TIP: I found it a trifle fiddly using copy and paste to make these
 copies. I didn't get the placement of the local cursor quite right, and
 I had to quantize the results. The next time I had to do this, I
 started with a segment one bar long, looped it, then when the time came
 to copy it three times, I marked it as repeating in the<B> Segment
 Parameters</B> box, then double clicked on three of the copies,
 selected all four segments, and used<B> Segments -&gt; Splint and Join -&gt;
 Join</B> to join them back into one; then I finished by un-checking
 repeat for the segment. It's a toss-up whether method B is faster, but
 it's definitely more precise.</I></P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="7_4_2">7.4.2 Adjusting Velocities with the
 Selection Event Filter</A></H3>
<P>One place where the selection event filter shines is in its ability
 to quickly focus in on a particular range of notes within a selection.
 In this example, I had an arpeggiated part that I entered with flat
 velocities, and I wanted to add some life to the performance by
 accenting the top and bottom notes, while bringing down the velocity in
 the middle. As the part cycled up and down through several chords, it
 was impossible to use the click-on-the-keyboard method I described
 earlier in this chapter to select only the events I wanted.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western"><A NAME="7_4_2_1">7.4.2.1 Make a Selection</A></H4>
<P>The first step is to select all the events in the four bars of the
 first chord using the <IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic55"

<H4 CLASS="western"><A NAME="7_4_2_2">7.4.2.2 Configure the Selection

<P>Next, I wanted to catch the middle notes notes, so I used the <IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM"
BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic56" SRC="../pixmaps/event-list-filter-selection.png"
> icon to summon the event filter dialog.</P>
<P>Then I used the <IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic57"
SRC="../pixmaps/dot-dot-dot-button.png" > icon to pop up the pitch

 pitch. In this case, E3.</P>

NAME="Graphic58" SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-event-filter-B.png" >
</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><I>TIP: I find it a bit
 tricky to use the pitch picker in this dialog from the matrix view
 because I'm comparing a constantly changing clef and staff to a pitch
 on a piano keyboard. I find it error prone, personally, and so I have
 taken to looking at the status bar at the bottom of the window as I
 hover over notes. It shows the absolute MIDI pitch, and makes it a
 breeze dialing the values I want straight in.</I></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->
I repeated the process for the<B> to:</B> pitch,
 selecting B#3. Since I wanted to select the notes in between these two
 extremes first, I left the associated combo box set to &quot;include.&quot; This
 caused it to include all the notes between E3 and B#3.
<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->
 Since I wanted
 to grab notes irrespective of duration or velocity, I left these
 filters at all-inclusive settings.</P>
<H4 ALIGN="LEFT" CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><A NAME="7_4_2_3">
7.4.2.3 Adjust the Velocities</A></H4>

 hit the filter again. It remembers the last settings you used, and you
 can fine tune it on subsequent runs until you get it just right.</I></P>
<P>Now that I had filtered the selection to the range of notes I wanted
 to affect, I used<B> shift+down</B> to lower all of these velocities at
 once, producing the following result:</P>
