<H1><A NAME="4">4 Managing &quot;Instrument Parameters&quot;</A></H1>
<P>Now that you understand have configured your default studio to suit
 your own needs, you might be wondering just how to make use of all
 those programs and controllers you set up. As I have mentioned in
 various other places, program changes and controllers in MIDI work on a
 channel level. That means they work on a track level within Rosegarden.
 On the audio side of the aisle, Rosegarden divides audio support into
 16 channels as well, and channel-specific settings such as volume
 levels and plugins can be configured at the track and channel level as
 well.</P>
<H2><A NAME="4_1">4.1 JACK Track or MIDI Track?</A></H2>
<P>When starting with a new track, or reconfiguring an existing one, the
 first decision you need to make is whether the track will be used for
 audio or MIDI. Regardless of whether you are displaying connections or
 track labels, you begin by clicking the mouse cursor in this area, and
 holding a moment until a menu appears.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
 You should be presented with a series of nested menus that allow you to
 choose the MIDI (or JACK) device and channel for the track. Let's have
 a look at MIDI first:</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
 This first layer of the menu tree allows you to route this track's
 output to a particular device. In this case, I chose to route it to my
 Roland Sound Canvas.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
 <IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="215" NAME="Graphic4" SRC="../pixmaps/select-midi.png"
WIDTH="253"></P>
<P>Leaving the menu selection on &quot;Roland SC-33&quot; a moment caused the menu
 on the far right to appear. By selecting &quot;Roland SC-33 #6 (Piano 1)&quot;
 from this final list, I assigned this track to the same channel and
 instrument parameters settings already in use by another track. I could
 just as easily have assigned it to a channel that had not yet been
 assigned elsewhere, and could have then used the Instrument Parameters
 box to select a program change. I will discuss this last idea a bit
 later.</P>
<H3><A NAME="4_1_1">4.1.1 What Do Those Black Boxes Mean?</A></H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">The column
 of small boxes to the left of the channel provide a concise way of
 showing information about the status of these connections. In the
 examples above, you might have noticed that they were in several
 different states.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
 These boxes convey the following information:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM"
BORDER="0" HEIGHT="15" NAME="Graphic38" SRC="../pixmaps/using-rosegarden_html_72a37f4e.png"

 now. It is is<B> not in use</B> by a track, and it is<B> not connected</B>
 to any active output path.</P>

BORDER="0" HEIGHT="12" NAME="Graphic79" SRC="../pixmaps/using-rosegarden_html_3dc467bd.png"
WIDTH="15"> This instrument or device could provide a valid output path,
 and all you need to do from here is attach it to a track and begin
 making use of it. It<B> is connected</B> to an active output path, but
 it is<B> not being used</B> by any track.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM"

 not currently a valid output path, and the events on any tracks that
 are connected don't have anywhere to go. This instrument or device is<B>
 in use</B> by a track, but is<B> not connected</B> to an active output
 path.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM"
BORDER="0" HEIGHT="16" NAME="Graphic80" SRC="../pixmaps/using-rosegarden_html_e634bf.png"
WIDTH="14"> This instrument or device provides a valid output path, and
 that path is in use by at least one track. It<B> has a valid connection</B>
 to an output path, and that connection is<B> in use</B> by a track.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
 In addition, the instrument in use by the current track will have an
 extra black outline around either a black filled or black outlined box,
 depending on whether or not the path is connected to a valid output:</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
 <IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="18" NAME="Graphic82" SRC="../pixmaps/using-rosegarden_html_500c240c.png"
WIDTH="18"> The active track is connected to an output that is<B> also
 connected</B>. If you play this track, you can expect the device you've
 hooked up to make some noise.</P>

 <IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="18" NAME="Graphic83" SRC="../pixmaps/using-rosegarden_html_5204c333.png"
WIDTH="18"> The active track is connected to an output that is<B> not
 connected</B>. This track, on the other hand, won't make any noise
 until you assign a different device to it or turn on the device that
 isn't currently working.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">Now that the
 track has been assigned to a MIDI output device, and is therefore a
 MIDI track, the<B> Instrument Parameters</B> box will display controls
 similar to these.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">They allow
 you to reassign the channel for this track, and to dial in a program.
 In this case, you can see Roland's variation system in action. The
 program is set to &quot;20. Churg Org. 1&quot; and the variation to &quot;17. Church
 Org. 3&quot; so this track will play using a pipe organ sound that isn't
 part of the basic set of General MIDI programs.</P>

<H2><A NAME="4_3">4.3 Creating a JACK Track</A></H2>
<P>If you want to use a track for audio, you'll need to make it a JACK
 track. The idea is exactly the same as a MIDI track, except you will
 only have one device to choose from, and it is called &quot;JACK Audio.&quot; (If
 you do not have a &quot;JACK Audio&quot; device available, please ensure that
 your JACK server is running. If you have problems with this, see &quot;You
 Don't Know JACK&quot; later on in this guide.)</P>

 layers of plugins. There are redundant Mute, Solo and Record toggles,
 as well as volume sliders for left and right</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">If you wish
 to assign plugins to the track, you may use one of the &quot;&lt;no plugin&gt;&quot;
 buttons to summon a dialog similar to this one. These controls will
 vary considerably from plugin to plugin. I will cover plugins in more
 depth later on, in &quot;You Don't Know JACK.&quot;</P>

<H1><A NAME="5">5 Recording Basics</A></H1>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">There are three different ways to record
 with Rosegarden. If you come from a MIDI background, the most obvious
 thing to do is plug in your MIDI keyboard and hit the record button to
 record a MIDI segment in the currently-selected track. If audio is your
 aim, you'll want to set your mixer recording source and get to work. On
 the other hand, if you have all the keyboard skill of a paraplegic
 chipmunk, like I do, you might be more interested in step recording.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">I will cover step recording later on.
 For now my focus is on recording operations that can be performed from
 the main window.</P>
