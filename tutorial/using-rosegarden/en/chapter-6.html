<H1>6 <A NAME="6"></A>You Don't Know JACK</H1>
<P>In order to make use of Rosegarden's audio features, you will need to
 run JACK.</P>
<P>JACK is short for the Jack Audio Connection Kit. This marvel is at
 the heart of Linux audio, and it allows for a level of interoperability
 between applications that's undreamt of in the world of proprietary
 software. Jack is the cement that binds together a host of varied
 applications, and lets them all work together seamlessly.</P>
<H2><A NAME="6_1">6.1 Starting and tweaking JACK</A></H2>
<P>The simplest way to control your JACK server is to use<B> qjackctl</B>
<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->

. It takes a lot of the sting out of the process, and presents you with
 a nice interface to show you how things are going. It is, of course,
 not a part of Rosegarden, and you will need to install it separately.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
HEIGHT="78" NAME="Graphic1" SRC="../pixmaps/qjackctl-overview.png" WIDTH="393"></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium">In the above example, you
 see what it's<B> supposed</B> to look like. Sometimes getting it to
 play nice is no mean feat. Notice in particular that I am showing 0 (0)
 where the xruns are reported. xruns are JACK's way of telling you that
 it isn't happy. They cause audio dropouts and bad performance. Your
 goal in tweaking JACK is to achieve the lowest latency possible while
 preventing xruns.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium">To change how your JACK
 server is configured, use the<B> Setup</B> button. Here you can see the
 settings that finally worked for me with my SB Live!. It's notable that
 I am running JACK strictly as a user, without real-time capabilities
 enabled. If you run JACK with real time turned on, you'll have to run
 qjackctl, JACK, and Rosegarden as root, or else you'll have to run a
 capabilities-enabled kernel so that you can run them with root
 privleges as your user.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><I>I think. Actually, I
 don't know. I have a hacked kernel, and no idea what to do with it.
 Nobody has ever answered any of my questions because I'm not a card
 carrying member of the Linux Audio Cult. The information out there is
 enormously complicated, and this whole area is nothing but pure voodoo.
 It absolutely<B> sucks</B>, truthfully.</I></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><I>Until someone reads this
 and finally shows me the light, we're both going to have to stumble
 blindly through the dark with nothing but my half-formed and probably
 pathetic understanding of how all of this is supposed to work. But I
 have indeed managed to accomplish a few things with this stuff, and I
 can show you how I did it.</I></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium">If you were running
 Rosegarden before starting JACK, you'll need to close Rosegarden and
 restart it in order to make its audio features available. I will cover
 the actual use of Rosegarden's features in Chapter 8. For now we are
 only concerned with how to get Rosegarden to cooperate with other
 JACK-enabled applications.</P>
<H2><A NAME="6_2">6.2 Using Rosegarden with a JACK-enabled Soft Synth</A>
</H2>
<P>Now that JACK is running and Rosegarden has hopefully set up some
 default JACK connections for you, you can take advantage of
 Rosegarden's ability to record and play audio.</P>
