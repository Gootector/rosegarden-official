<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">There are three different ways to record
 with Rosegarden. If you come from a MIDI background, the most obvious
 thing to do is plug in your MIDI keyboard and hit the record button to
 record a MIDI segment in the currently-selected track. If audio is your
 aim, you'll want to set your mixer recording source and get to work. On
 the other hand, if you have all the keyboard skill of a paraplegic
 chipmunk, like I do, you might be more interested in step recording.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">I will cover step recording later on.
 For now my focus is on recording operations that can be performed from
 the main window.</P>

<P STYLE="border: none; padding: 0in">If you route the track to a MIDI
 device, (including the &quot;Synth plugin&quot; device, if available), then the
 track will become a MIDI track, and it can only be used to play MIDI
 segments. If you drag an audio segment onto this track by mistake, the
 audio will not play. Conversely, if you route a track to the &quot;JACK
 Audio&quot; device, it will become an audio track, and it will not play any
 MIDI segments you happen to drag here by mistake.</P>
