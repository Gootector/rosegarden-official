<H1><A NAME="9">9 Managing Audio Projects (unwritten)</A></H1>
<P>This will pound on the importance of maintaining a separate audio
 directory for each new project, and demonstrate the use of the audio
 file manager. Perhaps other things, depending on what still needs
 mentioning after the chapter dealing with audio instruments is
 finalized. I've covered audio segments inline with MIDI segments
 already, and audio instruments with MIDI instruments, but I still need
 a home for audio file management issues. This is it, I guess.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="9_1">9.1 Mastering</A></H2>
<P>This chapter will eventually deal with the vagaries of putting audio
 and MIDI streams together and mixing them down into a finished .wav
 file.</P>
<P>I don't expect to get to this until last. In the meantime, I offer
 the following quick and dirty information:</P>
<P>You can master in one of two ways. One is to set up a dedicated
 mastering track and play everything while having Rosegarden record
 itself. You can use Rosegarden's internal MIDI and audio mixers to help
 make this job easier.</P>
<P>The more flexible way is to route Rosegarden's JACK outputs into
 something else, like JAMin or Ardour. JAMin looks like a promising tool
 here, but I haven't really explored it.</P>
