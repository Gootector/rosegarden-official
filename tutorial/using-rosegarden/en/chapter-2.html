<P>Before you start Rosegarden, you might want to make sure your
 configuration is in order. Many users have found that Rosegarden was
 unable to produce any sound out of the box.</P>
<P>If you are interested in working with MIDI, you should consider a few
 questions. Do you have a MIDI keyboard attached to your computer? Does
 your soundcard have an internal synth? Do you have it working
 correctly? Are you going to have to run a software synth such as
 QSynth? Can you play MIDI files (<B>.mid)</B>
<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->
? If you don't know the
 answers to these questions, you might want to turn to<A HREF="chapter-9.html/">
 &quot;MIDI Primer&quot;</A> and familiarize yourself with these basics.</P>
<P> If you play to use Rosegarden as an audio sequencer, you might do
 well to turn to<A HREF="chapter-7.html/"> &quot;Starting and Routing Audio
 Through JACK&quot;</A> to learn about starting the JACK audio server, and
 getting it to cooperate with any software synths you wish to run. The
 audio server must be running before you start Rosegarden in order for
 Rosegarden's audio features to be enabled.</P>
<P>After working through the material in these two appendices, you
 should be ready to come back here and get started in earnest.</P>
<P>Or, of course, you can jump in headlong, fire this thing up, and take
 it for a spin.</P>
<H2>2.2 <A NAME="2_1"></A>The Main Window</H2>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
 Let's begin by starting Rosegarden, and having a look at the main
 window. This is where you get an overall view of your work, and control
 a number of settings and parameters.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
 A Rosegarden document is called a composition. The main window is
 primarily dedicated to editing at the composition level, so most of
 these tools affect your document in a broad way. This is where you name
 tracks and assign instruments to them, create and manipulate segments,
 and watch a broad overview of playback. (I will explain these concepts
 in more detail later on.) This is also where you configure segment
 parameters such as label and color. Tempo and time signature settings
 exist a composition level, and they may be edited here in the main
 window using the tempo ruler.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">One of the

<H2><A NAME="2_4">2.4 The Tracklist</A></H2>
<P>Rosegarden is a track-based sequencer. Each entry in the tracklist is
 a separate track that can have individualized settings for several
 different parameters. Each track has a label and an output assignment,
 and can be used to record, play, and manipulate either MIDI or audio
 data, but never both.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">Rosegarden
 compositions are made up of segments, and editing at the composition
 level involves dragging them around and rearranging them within tracks.
 Segments are a universal container that may hold either MIDI events or
 audio data. Segments are rather similar to layers in an image editing
 program such as the GIMP. They can be cut, pasted, split, re-combined,
 overlapped and pretty much rearranged at will, and are very flexible.
 While there are understandably some differences in the way audio and
 MIDI segments behave, they can be manipulated in almost exactly the
 same way within the composition. The only real limitation is that audio
 segments and MIDI segments cannot both play in the same track.</P>

 If you have a segment where the treble and bass parts are jumbled
 together, you might wish to split this at middle C or thereabouts. You
 can use<B> Segments -&gt; Split and Join -&gt; Split by Pitch</B> and then
 make your selections for split point, clef handling, etc. from the
 resulting dialog. By default, this feature attempts to split the
 segment intelligently, so that you can hopefully avoid winding up with
 treble notes in the bass part, and bass notes in the treble part.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
 <IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="229" NAME="Graphic8" SRC="../pixmaps/main-split-by-pitch.png"

<P>Once split, the two segments will overlap exactly on the same track.
 It is impossible to select a segment that lies completely underneath
 another segment, so it is probably a good idea to move one of the two
 halves into a different track.</P>

 desired resolution. It will not change note durations in any way.</P>
<H3><A NAME="2_5_8">2.5.8 Transposing Instruments</A></H3>
<P>If you wish to write notation for transposing instruments, you can
 dial a transposition setting into the<B> Transpose</B> box. This will
 cause the part to sound in a different range from written. A typical Bb
 trumpet part, for example, should have -2 here. I'll cover this subject
 in more depth later on, in the Notation chapter.</P>
<H3><A NAME="2_5_9">2.5.9 Delay</A></H3>
<P>The<B> Delay</B> setting allows you to knock the timing of a segment

 especially amusing for transforming a nicely performed MIDI file into a
 simulation of a middle school band concert.</P>

 While you can't grab it and move it around directly, you can position

 note are the panic, metronome, and solo buttons. If they're missing,
 toggle the extra controls.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
 The panic button transmits a &quot;notes off&quot; message on every channel. It
 does not transmit an &quot;all notes off&quot; or a &quot;system reset&quot; or what have
 you, but litereally transmits a notes off on every channel on every
 device Rosegarden knows about. It can take quite a long time for all
 the events to transmit, which you can see happening by watching the
 &quot;OUT&quot; area in the Transport, but it's guaranteed to shut up that
 droning C# and then some.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
 The metronome does what you'd probably expect. You can turn the
 metronome on during normal playback, as well as recording, and it is a
 useful tool to use when practicing playing along with your composition.
 Configure it via<B> Composition -&gt; Studio -&gt; Manage Metronome</B>.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
 The solo button forces the Transport to play only whatever track is
 currently selected at the moment, independent of its mute state. (To
 &quot;solo&quot; more than one part, you'll need to set the mute for tracks
 individually, or by using<B> Tracks -&gt; Mute All Tracks</B> and then
 un-muting the parts you desire.)</P>

 like, the next time you start Rosegarden and attempt to load the file
 you were working on, you'll be presented with the option of loading the
 autosave file instead. If you hadn't yet saved the file, you'll find it
 in your ~/autosave directory with a basic name of &quot;untitled.&quot;</P>

 The autosave interval defaults to 60 seconds. Configure it via the
 Settings menu.</P>
