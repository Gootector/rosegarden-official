<H2 STYLE="border: none; padding: 0in">1.1 <A NAME="1_1"></A>What is
 Rosegarden?</H2>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
 Rosegarden-4, hereafter referred to as simply Rosegarden, is a
 versatile application that seeks to be a useful tool for those wanting
 to create music. It combines aspects of a MIDI (Musical Instrument
 Digital Interface) sequencer, an audio sequencer, and a notation editor
 into one convenient, easy to use package that provides users with a
 consistent and intuitive interface.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
 Rosegarden is one of many audio and MIDI applications and utilities for
 Linux, and it integrates well with related applications. This
 relationship centers around two different Linux standards. One the one
 hand, Rosegarden is closely tied to the Advanced Linux Sound
 Architecture (ALSA) MIDI infrastructure, and it works very well with
 other ALSA MIDI applications such as Qsynth, ZynAddSubFX and Hydrogen.
 On the other hand Rosegarden is also tied to the Jack Audio Connection
 Kit (JACK), and it works well with other JACK applications such as
 Ardour. Rosegarden can stand well on its own, but its true strength is
 in how well it combines with other applications as part of a total home
 studio solution.</P>
<H2 STYLE="border: none; padding: 0in"><A NAME="1_2">1.2 About This
 Guide</A></H2>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
 This guide is part manual, part tutorial. I attempt to showcase
 Rosegarden's most significant features, and give you suggestions for
 how to use (or work around) these features in order to achieve your
 musical goals.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
 This guide is generally arranged to be read from cover to cover, and to
 proceed through Rosegarden's feature set window by window in a logical
 way. If you wish to home straight in on a specific topic, the table of
 contents is thorough, and the web version is fully hyperlinked.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
 Each chapter is loosely divided into two parts. The first half details
 the mechanical side of making use of various controls in order to
 manipulate data in some way. The latter half focuses on demonstrating
 how to use these controls to achieve common musical goals.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
 Menu options and references to some dialog pages or tabs are formatted
 in bold, with arrows indicating the progression through the layers of
 menus. For example, if I say to use<B> File -&gt; Import -&gt; Import MIDI
 File</B> this means to begin at the &quot;File&quot; menu, find &quot;Import&quot; on this
 menu and hover on it until the submenu opens out, then click on &quot;Import
 MIDI File.&quot;</P>

 Various personal tips and &quot;unofficial&quot; workarounds are scattered
 throughout, set off in italics.</P>

 System Requirements</H2>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
 This document describes Rosegarden4, the latest in this venerable line
 of applications; not to be confused with the older Rosegarden that was
 last updated in 1997.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
 The new Rosegarden is a native KDE application that can run on any
 system that has the KDE and QT libraries installed, and currently
 requires a minimum of KDE/QT 3.1 in order to run. As of version 1.0,
 Rosegarden is closely tied to ALSA, and ALSA has not, to my knowledge,
 been ported to platforms like OS-X and FreeBSD. Until such porting
 occurs, the majority of Rosegarden's features are limited to the Linux
 platform exclusively. It should compile and run on other platforms, but
 most of its features will be disabled.</P>
<H3><A NAME="1_3_1">1.3.1 Linux Version</A></H3>
<P>The more recent your distribution, the better. Rosegarden and many
 related, interdependent applications are all very new. We at Rosegarden
 suggest that you run the very latest release version of the
 distribution of your choice, at a minimum. We further suggest that a
 distribution with special emphasis on Linux audio, such as<A HREF="http://www.agnula.org/">
 AGNULA</A> or<A HREF="http://ccrma.stanford.edu/planetccrma/software/introduction.html">
 Planet CCRMA</A> might well be worth your consideration if you find
 yourself having trouble getting all of these things to cooperate. Linux
 audio is a bit of an arcane and complex area at the present, and these
 special distributions seek to remove much of the sting. Having said all
 that, I've attained acceptable, if not ideal results using off the
 shelf Debian Sarge on a fast computer.</P>
<H3><A NAME="1_3_2">1.3.2 Equipment and Software Required to Produce
 Sound</A></H3>
<P>Many users have written to ask why they are unable to get Rosegarden
 to play any music. Many common, inexpensive soundcards lack the
 capability to play MIDI on their own. The vendors who sell these cards
 ship them with drivers for Windows that make up for this deficiency by
 providing support for MIDI production in software. ALSA provides no
 such support directly, and users of these cards will have to run a
 software synth such as QSynth, or else they will need to make use of an
 external MIDI keyboard or sound module in order to play MIDI. To the
 extent of my own direct knowledge, very nearly every soundcard I have
 ever encountered has fallen into this category. The only exceptions I
 know about are all Sound Blaster cards or compatible clones based on
 some variety of EMU chipset. These include the AWE series, the Live!
 series, and the Audigy series cards; all of which have the ability to
 play MIDI in hardware. Users who have other hardware will probably need
 to run QSynth. Users with computers too slow to run QSynth effectively
 (probably anything less than 800 MHz) should probably consider
 investing in a Sound Blaster Live! at a minimum.</P>
<P>If you need to use a software synth such as QSynth for MIDI
 production, I have found that an 800 MHz machine with 128 MB of RAM is
 the minimum spec box that I could get working acceptably. This machine
 was completely useless when using JACK, so I had to run Rosegarden with
 its audio features disabled, and I had to play QSynth through the ALSA
 output, rather than the more usual JACK output. (I will cover these
 topics in detail in &quot;Starting and Routing Audio Through JACK,&quot; so don't
 despair if you have no idea what I'm talking about.)</P>
<P>To get the most out of Rosegarden with the least amount of kernel
 hacking and other tweaking, I've found a 2.0 GHz P4 with 512 MB of RAM
 delivers acceptable MIDI and audio performance using a standard,
 unpatched 2.4 kernel, running both JACK and Rosegarden with normal user
 privileges, using a cheap Wal-Mart Sound Blaster Live!.</P>
<H3><A NAME="1_3_3">1.3.3 Suggested Minimum Hardware</A></H3>
<P>My recommended<B> minimum</B> soundcard for a desktop machine is an
 emu101k-based card such as the venerable Sound Blaster Live! and its
 many descendants and clones. This card can do in hardware most of what
 QSynth can do with software, so you have a decent internal synth for
 MIDI performance without the CPU penalties. You can still run QSynth if
 you want (CPU performance allowing) to take advantage of its integrated
 LADSPA plugins for effects. It has a joystick port MIDI adapter
 (additional Y-cable or interface box required) for interfacing with
 external MIDI devices, and it can just barely be coaxed into
 functioning with JACK without resorting to kernel hacking and arcane
 audio performance tweaking. A $15 SB Live! and a $50 Wal-Mart home
 theater system make for a rather decent sounding home audio solution on
 the cheap.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">If you are a laptop user, you may well be
 forced to settle for a low quality integrated audio solution such as
 the common Intel i810 or VIA via82xx. These will not provide an
 external MIDI interface, and they do not have a hardware synth. You'll
 have to run something like QSynth to play MIDI, and you won't be able
 to play or record a MIDI keyboard unless you have some kind of
 additional hardware. In truth, the closest thing to a laptop I've ever
 used was one of those PC Luggables. I have no idea what I mean by
 &quot;additional hardware&quot; really, but I gather there are USB MIDI
 interfaces that work with ALSA.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">For real performance, you will probably
 want to look at professional level soundcards. The mAudio Audiophile
 2426 comes highly recommended as a good entry level card. It has a MIDI
 interface, but only sports a limited number of inputs and outputs.
 Serious audio people will probably want to look beyond the Audiophile
 and get into serious money and performance territory. Better solutions
 offer more inputs and outputs, and nice extras such as breakout boxes,
 but many do not offer MIDI ports, so you're stuck buying additional
 hardware if you want to use external MIDI gear.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">In writing this document, I assume that
 most of my readers are weekend jammers like me, trying to make the best
 of low quality hardware, and are too cheap or too broke to buy
 something better. I focus on the Sound Blaster Live! as the lowest
 common denominator, because dealing with that card has the greatest
 chance of being useful to the largest number of people, and because
 it's a decent, if inferior, all-in-one solution as the centerpiece of a
 home studio.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">If someone wants to buy me some pro gear,
 or a laptop, a USB MIDI interface, etc. I will be happy to describe how
 it works in more detail. :)</P>
