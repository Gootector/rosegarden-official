</A> What is Rosegarden?</H2>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
 Rosegarden-4, hereafter referred to as simply Rosegarden, is a
 versatile, open source music creation tool. It combines aspects of a
 MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) sequencer, an audio
 sequencer, and a notation editor into one convenient, powerful, easy to
 use package that provides users with a consistent and intuitive
 interface.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
 Rosegarden makes use of two powerful and flexible subsystems available
 to Linux. For MIDI operations, Rosegarden employs the<A HREF="http://www.alsa-project.org/">
 ALSA</A> (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) MIDI sequencer
 infrastructure for routing in-coming and out-going MIDI events. It can
 record from any number of inputs simultaneously, and out-going events
 can be routed to any of myriad MIDI clients.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
 For audio recording and playback, Rosegarden is one of numerous
 applications that make use of the Jack Audio Connection Kit, or<A HREF="http://jackit.sourceforge.net/">
 JACK</A>, a low-latency sound server designed from the ground up to
 meet the demands of professional musicians. Hand in hand with JACK,
 Rosegarden can apply<A HREF="http://www.ladspa.org/"> LADSPA</A> (Linux
 Audio Developer's Simple Plugin API) plugins to audio streams on the
 fly, providing effects ranging from EQ to reverb and virtually
 everything in between. These plugins can be layered on top of each
 other for yet more possibilities.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
 Bridging the gap between these two technologies, Rosegarden is the
 first MIDI sequencer to employ the new<A HREF="http://dssi.sourceforge.net/">
 DSSI</A> (Disposable Soft Synth Interface) plugin architecture. MIDI
 events are routed through ALSA into DSSI synth plugins, and audio
 produced by these plugins can in turn be routed through LADSPA plugins
 and thence to JACK.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
 Rosegarden provides three distinct ways of viewing, editing, and
 entering MIDI events, including a powerful notation editor that
 provides many advanced features not typically found in the notation
 facility of MIDI sequencers. Underneath these three editors, Rosegarden
 provides a segment-based mechanism for arranging blocks of MIDI and
 audio data on a canvas that brings the potential of a layer-based image
 editing program to the realm of music.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
 All of this flexibility means you can use Rosegarden as the center of a
 very powerful home studio and music composition solution for Linux.</P>

1.2 About This Guide</A></H2>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
 This guide is part manual, part tutorial. I attempt to showcase
 Rosegarden's most significant features, and give you suggestions for
 how to use these features in order to achieve your musical goals.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
 This guide is generally arranged to be read from cover to cover, and to
 proceed through Rosegarden's feature set window by window in a logical
 way. If you wish to home straight in on a specific topic, the table of
 contents is thorough, and the web version is fully hyperlinked.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
 Each chapter is loosely divided into two parts. The first half details
 the mechanical side of making use of various controls in order to
 manipulate data in some way. The latter half focuses on demonstrating
 how to use these controls to achieve common musical goals.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
 Menu options and references to some dialog pages or tabs are formatted
 in bold, with arrows indicating the progression through the layers of
 menus. For example, if I say to use<B> File -&gt; Import -&gt; Import MIDI
 File</B> this means to begin at the &quot;File&quot; menu, find &quot;Import&quot; on this
 menu and hover on it until the submenu opens out, then click on &quot;Import
 MIDI File.&quot;</P>

</A> Version and System Requirements</H2>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
 This document describes Rosegarden-4, the latest in this venerable line
 of applications. Some distributions still carry the older Rosegarden 2,
 last updated in 1997. Rosegarden-4 is a completely modern KDE
 application, and version 1.0 was released in 2004.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
 The new Rosegarden is a native KDE application that can run on any
 system that has the KDE and QT libraries installed, and currently
 requires a minimum of KDE/QT 3.1 in order to run. Rosegarden depends on
 a number of libraries and architectural features that are currently
 only found in Linux. A few brave individuals are interested in porting
 it to FreeBSD and OS-X, but at this time no one has been successful,
 and Rosegarden remains, effectively, an application only for Linux.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
 Rosegarden requires several fairly new libraries in order for all of
 its features to work correctly. Synth plugins, especially, require a
 library that not many distros were carrying at this writing. If
 anything documented in this book seems not to exist, please ask your
 distro package maintainers to pick up the requisite libraries and
 compile Rosegarden against them. Unfortunately, building Rosegarden
 from source is well beyond the scope of this book.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="1_3_1">1.3.1 Linux Version</A></H3>
<P>The more recent your distribution, the better. Rosegarden and many
 related, interdependent applications are all very new. We at Rosegarden
 suggest that you run the very latest release version of the
 distribution of your choice, at a minimum. We further suggest that a
 distribution with special emphasis on Linux audio, such as<A HREF="http://www.agnula.org/">
 AGNULA</A> or<A HREF="http://ccrma.stanford.edu/planetccrma/software/introduction.html">
 Planet CCRMA</A> might well be worth your consideration if you find
 yourself having trouble getting all of these things to cooperate. Linux
 audio is a bit of an arcane and complex area at the present, and these
 special distributions seek to remove much of the sting. I've attained
 acceptable, if not ideal results using off the shelf Debian Sarge on a
 fast computer, but this is more due to my stubbornness than any matter
 of practicality. I heartily recommend that you make use of the Planet
 or AGNULA.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="1_3_2">1.3.2 Equipment and Software
 Required</A></H3>
<P>Many people are running Rosegarden successfully on older, slower
 hardware. However, your CPU can't be too fast, and you can't have too
 much RAM or hard disk space. The more resources your computer can bring
 to the table, the more you will be able to do successfully with
 Rosegarden. The following is a quick list of basic requirements you
 will need to satisfy in order to be able to do different kinds of work
 with Rosegarden.</P>
