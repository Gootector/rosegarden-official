<H1><A NAME="5">5 Managing Instruments (mostly finished)</A></H1>
<P>You want to play a particular track using a hammered dulcimer, or
 else you've got an audio track that needs some EQ. In either case, you
 need an introduction to the<B> instrument</B>. Instruments are
 configured with the<B> Instrument Parameters</B> box, and any number of
 tracks can be assigned to play via the same instrument.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="5_1">5.1 Instruments</A></H2>
<P>The previous chapter introduced you to the device, which is a
 construct Rosegarden uses to encapsulate information about what lies on
 the other side of a play or record connection, and make the
 capabilities of that equipment available to you. Hand in hand with the
 device is the<B> instrument</B>.</P>
<P>Every device has 16 instruments numbered #1 through #16. When working
 with MIDI playback devices, each of these instruments encapsulates a
 MIDI output channel (the same channel as the number of the instrument
 by default, although this relationship is not fixed), a
 bank/program/variation assignment, and any initial controllers you wish
 to affect the associated channel. These instruments allow you to
 assemble up to 16 collections of programs/controllers per device and
 assign these combinations to any number of tracks. If your JACK server
 is running (and if your distro compiled and packaged Rosegarden
 properly), you should have both an &quot;Audio&quot; device and a &quot;Synth plugin&quot;
 device in addition to however few or many MIDI devices you have
 available. Each and every one of these has 16 instruments.</P>
<P>When working with audio and synth plugins, these instruments serve
 the same purpose as MIDI channels, allowing you to configure up to 16
 different combinations of LADSPA plugins, volume and pan settings,
 programs (for synth plugins) and so forth, and then apply these
 combinations to any number of different tracks.</P>
<P>I'll try to illustrate the point with some diagrams depicting the
 three general types of instruments. Here we have a sample MIDI
 instrument that will play using a hammered dulcimer program. All tracks
 assigned to play via this instrument will play using the first output
 port on the Sound Blaster Live!, using program 16 from bank 0 0, with
 an initial volume of 100, and an initial reverb level of 97. This
 instrument will show up as &quot;Sound Blaster Live! (1) #12 (Hammered
 Dulcimer)&quot; on the menu.</P>
<P><I>NOTE: While the instrument number and channel do coincide by
 default, it's possible to change this relationship. I have done so in
 this example. Instrument #12 plays using channel 6.</I></P>
<P><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic10" SRC="../pixmaps/instrument-diagram.jpg"
></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">This is a typical synth plugin instrument. The sound it
 makes will depend on the synth plugin used, but all tracks assigned to
 play via this instrument will make the same sound. Its output will be
 piped through the EQ and Reverb plugins, and this instrument will show
 up as &quot;Synth plugin #12&quot; on the menu.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic11"
SRC="../pixmaps/plugin-instrument-diagram.jpg" ></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">This is a typical audio instrument. Any audio tracks
 assigned to play via this instrument will have their output piped
 through the EQ and Reverb plugins, and this instrument will show up as
 &quot;Audio #12&quot; on the menu.</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic12"
SRC="../pixmaps/jack-instrument-diagram.jpg" ></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
<BR>
<BR></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Notice that all of the above examples were &quot;instrument
 #12,&quot; and yet all three of them will produce quite different results,
 because each of them is the &quot;instrument #12&quot; of a completely different
 device.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="5_2">5.2 Routing a Track to a Device and
 Instrument</A></H2>
<P>The first step in the assignment process is to route a track to a
 particular device. The device you use will determine whether you can
 play audio or MIDI data on this track. In order to make this device
 assignment, begin by clicking the mouse cursor in this area, and
 holding a moment until a context menu appears.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
 <IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic3" SRC="../pixmaps/click-and-hold.png"
></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
 You should be presented with a series of two menus that allow you to
 choose first the device and then the instrument for this track.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
 In this case, I chose to route it to my &quot;Roland SC-33&quot; device, which is
 ultimately connected through my Rosegarden studio to play through ALSA
 port 64:0, and thus the Roland Sound Canvas I have plugged into the box
 physically attached to my computer.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
 Then I assigned it to that device's instrument #6. Prior to taking this
 snapshot, I had already configured this instrument to play using the
 &quot;Piano 1&quot; program with the<B> Instrument Parameters</B> box (more on
 that in a bit), and so that name appeared in parenthesis in the second
 menu. If an instrument hasn't already been directed to make use of a
 particular program, only the instrument number will appear on this
 menu, as is the case for most of the other instruments depicted.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
 <IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic4" SRC="../pixmaps/select-midi.png"
></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
 Notice also that instrument #10 has (D) in parenthesis, indicating that
 this instrument is normally used for playing drums. (Whether it
 actually plays drums depends on the capabilities of the MIDI equipment
 or software synth represented by this &quot;device,&quot; and probably depends on
 this instrument continuing to remain at the default channel assignment
 of 10.) In this example, I arranged beforehand for this instrument to
 play using the &quot;Power&quot; drum kit.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
 The remaining &quot;instruments&quot; are not assigned to anything in particular
 yet, and on most General MIDI-compliant equipment (or software synths)
 these &quot;instruments&quot; will probably play using a factory default piano
 program, with volume and other controllers set to neutral default
 values. Some equipment may not actually produce any noise until you
 explicitly assign a program to any instruments you use.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="5_3">5.3 MIDI Instrument Parameters</A></H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">Now that the
 track has had its output routed to a MIDI output device and instrument,
 and is therefore a MIDI track, the<B> Instrument Parameters</B> box
 will display controls similar to these. They allow you to reassign the
 channel for this &quot;instrument,&quot; and to dial in a program. Depending on
 how your synth/soundfont is set up, you may have to deal with a few
 different scenarios here.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="5_3_1">5.3.1 Simple General MIDI
 Instruments</A></H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">At the
 simple end, assigning a &quot;Harpsichord&quot; program to a basic General MIDI
 device only requires that you use the<B> Program</B> combo box to pick
 out the appropriate name.</P>

 Instruments</A></H3>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
 With any of the GS devices from the Library, you can dial in both the
 program and variation. For example, &quot;Church Org 3&quot; is a variation of
 &quot;Church Org 1.&quot; In order to get here, dial &quot;Church Org 1&quot; into the<B>
 Program</B> combo box, and then dial through the possible variations
 with the<B> Variation</B> combo box.</P>

></P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="5_3_3">5.3.3 Drum Instruments</A></H3>
<P>Most MIDI equipment has some way of playing drums using a bank of
 percussion sounds that are mapped to various pitches on the keyboard.
 Basic General MIDI equipment has only one standard drum kit, and you
 most likely need not do more than assign an instrument to output on
 channel 10 in order to make use of it. Most higher-end equipment and
 many soundfonts offer alternatives to this standard kit.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="5_3_4">5.3.4 GS Drum Kits</A></H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">The GS drum
 kits and the Capital Tones/General MIDI programs are both in bank 0 0.
 If a particular channel on the hardware is set to be in drum mode, that
 channel will respond to program changes by playing with alternate drum
 kits; otherwise it will play programs and variations in the usual
 fashion. For our purposes here, it is sufficient to know that channel
 10 is normally in drum mode by default. In order to access the
 alternate set of programs for bank 0 0, check the<B> [x] Percussion</B>
 checkbox, then dial a new kit into the<B> Program</B> combo box. Here I
 have dialed in the &quot;Power&quot; kit for my Sound Canvas.</P>

</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="5_3_5">5.3.5 Alternate Drums in Separate
 Banks</A></H3>
<P>The pattern for most other equipment, and for most soundfonts, is to
 put alternate drum kits into bank 1 0. To get to the &quot;TR 808&quot; kit in
 the &quot;PC51f.sf2&quot; soundfont I normally use on my Sound Blaster Live!, I
 dialed in bank 1 0 and program 26.</P>

<I> NOTE: If your knobs do not have a crisp, clear appearance like the
 ones above, you might need to increase your KDE color contrast to a
 higher setting. Low contrast produces rather fuzzy, indistinct knobs.
 Adjust this with KDE's Control Panel (kcontrol), under<B> Appearance &amp;

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">These
 initial controllers here inside the instrument provide the mechanism
 whereby you configure initial volume, pan, and similar settings for the
 track (if supported by the equipment, and properly configured into the
 device.) Any tracks that are routed to play through this instrument
 will share this instrument's parameters.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">If you
 change these knobs in the middle of playing a composition, the new
 settings should take effect immediately. However, they are still only
 initial settings for the instrument, and the new setting will be in
 effect after you've rewound the composition to the beginning.. If, for
 example, you want to change the pan setting in the middle of a
 composition, you must do it by inserting controller events from the
 event list editor, or from a controller ruler in either the matrix or
 notation editors, as I will explain in due course.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in"><I>NOTE: If
 you notice that your initial controllers are not taking effect, as can
 sometimes be the case when you have changed a controller value in the
 middle of a composition, and have rewound it to the beginning, you may
 need to check<B> Settings -&gt; Configure Rosegarden -&gt; Sequencer -&gt; Send

 you should have a &quot;Synth plugin&quot; device available. Each of the 16 synth
 plugin instruments can take a different synth plugin, and can have up
