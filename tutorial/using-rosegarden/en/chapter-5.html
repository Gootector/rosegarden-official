<H1><A NAME="5">5 Managing Instruments (under construction)</A></H1>
<P>You want to play a particular track using a hammered dulcimer, or
 else you've got an audio track that needs some EQ. In either case, you
 need an introduction to the<B> instrument</B>. Instruments are
 configured with the<B> Instrument Parameters</B> box, and any number of
 tracks can be assigned to play via the same instrument.</P>
<H2><A NAME="5_1">5.1 Instruments</A></H2>
<P>The previous chapter introduced you to the device, which is a
 construct Rosegarden uses to encapsulate information about what lies on
 the other side of a play or record connection, and make the
 capabilities of that equipment available to you. Hand in hand with the
 device is the<B> instrument</B>
<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->
.</P>
<P>Every device has 16 instruments numbered #1 through #16. When working
 with MIDI playback devices, each of these instruments encapsulates a
 MIDI output channel (the same channel as the number of the instrument
 by default, although this relationship is not fixed), a
 bank/program/variation assignment, and any initial controllers you wish
 to affect the associated channel. These instruments allow you to
 assemble up to 16 collections of programs/controllers per device and
 assign these combinations to any number of tracks. If your JACK server
 is running, you should have both an &quot;Audio&quot; device and a &quot;Synth plugin&quot;
 device in addition to however few or many MIDI devices you have
 available. Each and every one of these has 16 instruments.</P>
<P>When working with audio and synth plugins, these instruments serve
 the same purpose as MIDI channels, allowing you to configure up to 16
 different combinations of LADSPA plugins, volume and pan settings,
 programs (for synth plugins) and so forth, and then apply these
 combinations to any number of different tracks.</P>
<P>I'll try to illustrate the point with some diagrams depicting the
 three general types of instruments. Here we have a sample MIDI
 instrument that will play using a hammered dulcimer program. All tracks
 assigned to play via this instrument will play using the first output
 port on the Sound Blaster Live!, using program 16 from bank 0 0, with
 an initial volume of 100, and an initial reverb level of 97. This
 instrument will show up as &quot;Sound Blaster Live! (1) #12 (Hammered
 Dulcimer)&quot; on the menu.</P>
<P><I>NOTE: While the instrument number and channel do coincide by
 default, it's possible to change this relationship. I have done so in
 this example. Instrument #12 plays using channel 6.</I></P>
<P><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic10" SRC="../pixmaps/instrument-diagram.jpg"
></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">This is a typical synth plugin instrument. The sound it
 makes will depend on the synth plugin used, but all tracks assigned to
 play via this instrument will make the same sound. Its output will be
 piped through the EQ and Reverb plugins, and this instrument will show
 up as &quot;Synth plugin #12&quot; on the menu.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic11"
SRC="../pixmaps/plugin-instrument-diagram.jpg" ></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">This is a typical audio instrument. Any audio tracks
 assigned to play via this instrument will have their output piped
 through the EQ and Reverb plugins, and this instrument will show up as
 &quot;Audio #12&quot; on the menu.</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic12"
SRC="../pixmaps/jack-instrument-diagram.jpg" ></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
<BR>
<BR></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Notice that all of the above examples were &quot;instrument
 #12,&quot; and yet all three of them will produce quite different results,
 because each of them is the &quot;instrument #12&quot; of a completely different
 device.</P>
<H2><A NAME="5_2">5.2 Routing a Track to a Device and Instrument</A></H2>
<P>The first step in the assignment process is to route a track to a
 particular device. The device you use will determine whether you can
 play audio or MIDI data on this track. In order to make this device
 assignment, begin by clicking the mouse cursor in this area, and
 holding a moment until a context menu appears.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
 <IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic3" SRC="../pixmaps/click-and-hold.png"
></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
 You should be presented with a series of two menus that allow you to
 choose first the device and then the instrument for this track.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
 In this case, I chose to route it to my &quot;Roland SC-33&quot; device, which is
 ultimately connected through my Rosegarden studio to play through ALSA
 port 64:0, and thus the Roland Sound Canvas I have plugged into the box
 physically attached to my computer.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
 Then I assigned it to that device's instrument #6. Prior to taking this
 snapshot, I had already configured this instrument to play using the
 &quot;Piano 1&quot; program with the<B> Instrument Parameters</B> box (more on
 that in a bit), and so that name appeared in parenthesis in the second
 menu. If an instrument hasn't already been directed to make use of a
 particular program, only the instrument number will appear on this
 menu, as is the case for most of the other instruments depicted.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
 <IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic4" SRC="../pixmaps/select-midi.png"
></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
 Notice also that instrument #10 has (D) in parenthesis, indicating that
 this instrument is normally used for playing drums. (Whether it
 actually plays drums depends on the capabilities of the MIDI equipment
 or software synth represented by this &quot;device,&quot; and probably depends on
 this instrument continuing to remain at the default channel assignment
 of 10.) In this example, I arranged beforehand for this instrument to
 play using the &quot;Power&quot; drum kit.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
 The remaining &quot;instruments&quot; are not assigned to anything in particular
 yet, and on most General MIDI-compliant equipment (or software synths)
 these &quot;instruments&quot; will probably play using a factory default piano
 program, with volume and other controllers set to neutral default
 values. Some equipment may not actually produce any noise until you
 explicitly assign a program to any instruments you use.</P>
<H2><A NAME="5_3">5.3 MIDI Instrument Parameters</A></H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">Now that the
 track has had its output routed to a MIDI output device and instrument,
 and is therefore a MIDI track, the<B> Instrument Parameters</B> box
 will display controls similar to these.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
 <IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic2" SRC="../pixmaps/instrument-parameters-midi-ins.png"
></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">They allow
 you to reassign the channel for this &quot;instrument,&quot; and to dial in a
 program. In this case, you can see Roland's variation system in action.
 The program is set to &quot;20. Churg Org. 1&quot; and the variation to &quot;17.
 Church Org. 3&quot; so this &quot;instrument,&quot; and any tracks routed through it,
 will play using a pipe organ sound that isn't part of the basic set of
 General MIDI programs.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">You may
 change the default controller values by adjusting the knobs. The
 tooltip explains how to use them just as well as I could.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
<I> NOTE: If your knobs do not have a crisp, clear appearance like the
 ones above, you might need to increase your KDE color contrast to a
 higher setting. Low contrast produces rather fuzzy, indistinct knobs.
 Adjust this with KDE's Control Panel (kcontrol), under<B> Appearance &amp;
 Themes -&gt; Colors</B>

<H3><A NAME="5_3_1">5.3.1 Setting Initial Track Volume and Other
 Parameters</A></H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">These
 initial controllers here inside the instrument provide the mechanism
 whereby you configure initial volume, pan, and similar settings for the
 track. Any tracks that are routed to play through this instrument will
 share this instrument's parameters.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">The
 controllers displayed here for you to adjust will be those which were
 defined for the device while configuring the studio, or those you got
 for free from the original default studio. The particular values you
 set here will be bound up with this particular instrument on this
 particular channel. They are initial values only, and any of these
 controllers may be adjusted in the middle of a composition by inserting
 controller events, as we shall see in the next chapter.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in"><I>NOTE: If
 you notice that your initial controllers are not taking effect, as can
 sometimes be the case when you have changed a controller value in the
 middle of a composition, and have rewound it to the beginning, you may
 need to check<B> Settings -&gt; Configure Rosegarden -&gt; Sequencer -&gt; Send
 all MIDI Controllers at start of playback [x]</B></I></P>

<I>
<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->
 NOTE: The controllers here in this box are initial values only. If
 you have the playback pointer aimed somewhere in the middle of the
 document, and then adjust one of these knobs, do not expect the
 controller adjustment to take place at the location of the playback
 pointer. If you wish to make such adjustments, you should use one of
 the control rulers from one of the edit views, as I will discuss in the
 next chapter.</I></P>
<H3><A NAME="5_3_2">5.3.2 Selecting a GS Drum Kit</A></H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">If you want
 to select a GS-style drum kit, your<B> Instrument Parameters</B> box
 should look something like this. The GS drum kits are in the same bank
 0 0 as the Capital Tones/General MIDI programs. The checkbox allows you
 to toggle which set of programs you see, so you can use the Program
 combo box to more effectively change drum kits.</P>

 in a particular plugin with the<B> Plugin:</B> selector. As you dial

 change to reflect the controls that are available for this particular
 plugin; ranging from one knob to a screen full of them. You can layer
 up to five plugins for each instrument in the &quot;JACK Audio&quot; device,
 hardware allowing. Some plugins are particularly expensive in their use
 of your system's resources, so using too many may cause performance
 problems.</P>
