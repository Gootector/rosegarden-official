<H1>The Studio</H1>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">Now that
you have a general idea how Rosegarden works, now is a good time to
think about telling Rosegarden something about the MIDI equipment you
wish to use. Before we get started, some of you might need some basic
background information so that you can dive into this with some
understanding of the concepts I am about to explain. If you are new
to MIDI, or if anything in this chapter leaves you scratching your
head, you might want to read through my MIDI Primer in Appendix A.</P>
<H2>What is a &quot;studio&quot;?</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Every native Rosegarden composition
(.rg) file contains a studio definition in addition to all the nuts
and bolts stuff of music. This studio definition is a description of
the capabilities of the MIDI equipment and/or software synths you
have attached to or running on your computer. It allows you forget
about all of these arcane details and quickly dial up the sounds you
want, just as soon as you get it configured correctly. It does remain
with the file for life, and it is attached to the file, not to your
configuration of Rosegarden as a whole.</P>
<H3>What is a &quot;device&quot;?</H3>
<P>A &quot;device&quot; is a sort of imaginary virtual model of an
individual piece of MIDI equipment. It encapsulates information about
the capabilities of your equipment, and allows you to make use of
those capabilities from within Rosegarden. Rosegarden will talk to
this virtual &quot;device&quot; and whatever characteristics you
define here will be all it really knows about the physical equipment
(or software) this virtual construct represents.</P>
<H3>autoload.rg</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">If you start Rosegarden with no file
to open, it opens a default blank document, called <B>autoload.rg</B>.
Initially, this will be the system default that was installed with
Rosegarden. You can replace this with your own version unique to you,
and you should consider doing so just as soon as you have gotten your
studio tweaked to your satisfaction. I feel that it's very important
to point this out before you even get started configuring your
studio, because you should realize that only documents you create
<I>after</I> modifying your <B>autoload.rg</B> will take your new
settings. If you load an old document, or a document someone created
in a different studio environment, you will probably have to manually
adjust it to your current environment.</P>
<H2>Describing the Capabilities of the Equipment</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">The first
step in this process is to open the main Studio dialog. <B>Composition
-&gt; Studio -&gt; Manage MIDI Devices...</B> 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
or by clicking on the 
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/studio-icon.png" NAME="Graphic5" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=31 HEIGHT=24 BORDER=0>
icon.</P>
<P>You'll be presented with a dialog that resembles this one, except,
of course, that this one has already largely been configured to suit
my own default studio. It is divided into two sections; one for play
devices, and one for record devices. It also shows you how each of
these devices is connected to internal, external, and software
synths. In this example, I have a device named &quot;Roland SC-33&quot;
connected to &quot;64:0 EMU101K MPU-401 (UART) (duplex)&quot; and
four &quot;SB Live (?)&quot; devices connected to each of 65:0
through 65:3, which are the four output ports on my SB Live!. I also
have three generic spots reserved for soft synths, named &quot;Soft
Synth 1&quot; through &quot;Soft Synth 3&quot;, one of which is
currently connected to KAMix, an ALSA mixer client that can be
controlled via MIDI.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/manage-devices-dialog.png" NAME="Graphic1" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=469 HEIGHT=307 BORDER=0></P>
<H3>Connections</H3>
<P>You might wonder about the strange names numbers you see in front
of you in the Connection column. These provide you with a mechanism
for telling Rosegarden what you have plugged into which jack on your
computer. Sometimes these &quot;jacks&quot; are imaginary, and
sometimes they are real. Even if your soundcard is inside your
computer, or your &quot;soundcard&quot; is actually a software synth
like QSynth, it still has a virtual jack, and you need to plug
Rosegarden into it. Whether real or imaginary, these &quot;jacks&quot;
come from ALSA, and they are more properly known as &quot;ports.&quot;</P>
<P>ALSA assigns numbers to ports in three ranges. 64: means it is an
external MIDI port, which might be connected to a MIDI keyboard,
sound module, or other noise producing gadget through some sort of
cable. 65: means it is a virtual port with an internal synth such as
the Sound Blaster Live! on the other side. Software synths like
Hydrogen, ZynAddSubFX and the like will take numbers at the time
they're started, on a first-come, first served basis starting at
128:. In addition to the number, most of these will have some kind of
vaguely descriptive text component, such as &quot;Emu10k1 Port 0
(write).&quot; These names are provided by the underlying kernel
driver, and don't always make a lot of sense. That's why Rosegarden
allows you give your devices a proper name.</P>
<P>You will not generally need to rearrange these connections for
either internal or external devices. The only time I find myself
frequently changing connections around is when dealing with software
synths, as I will explain later on.</P>
<H3>Record Devices</H3>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
Record devices are MIDI keyboards, virtual keyboards, MIDI guitars
and the like. As record devices are rather less complicated, I will
mention them first. With a record device, you have no capabilities to
describe. The only thing Rosegarden can do is read data from it, or
not. You may name these if you wish, but the <B>Record devices</B>
section of this dialog is the only place where you will see the
names, and I never bother to name mine.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
[Multiple inputs in testing, TBA]</P>
<H3><B>Play Devices</B></H3>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
Play devices are where all the fun, and all the complexity is. They
can be MIDI keyboards, sound modules, software synths, samplers, and
pretty well anything else that can take MIDI input, such as KAMix.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
Let us assume for example you have a Roland SC-33 sound module hooked
up to your computer. It can receive on 16 channels, and it is capable
of playing your notes using any of 300-odd different sounds. It
responds to a variety of controllers. In order to control these
features from Rosegarden, you must tell Rosegarden about them, so it
can add them to its virtual model of your equipment.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
(For more discussion of banks, programs and controllers, see the <A HREF="http://chapter-9.html/">MIDI
Primer</A> in Appendix A.</P>
<H3>The Bank Editor</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
To load or create sets of program or controller descriptions, click
on the <B>Banks...</B> button to pop up the bank editor dialog. In
this example, you can see that I have already imported some programs
from the soundfont I use on my SB Live!, and I have named the four
devices &quot;SB Live! (1)&quot; through &quot;SB Live! (4)&quot; for
my own convenience. This soundfont has programs available in four
banks, which are displayed as the branches of the tree. The LSB
column is not visible in this snapshot, but the bank names tell most
of the tale. I named the last one &quot;Percussion&quot; to set it
apart, because that is where this soundfont stores the drum kits.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
You can also see that I have a device called &quot;Soft Synth 2&quot;
highlighted, and I'm looking at the empty list of programs that make
up Rosegarden's virtual model for this device. Unlike internal and
external MIDI equipment, Rosegarden assigns connections to soft
synths on a first-come, first serve basis, based on the order in
which the applications are started. It is very easy to wind up with
something named &quot;Hydrogen&quot; that is actually connected to
QSynth. I find I prefer to give these things generic names and assign
the connections manually as required, because I start and stop soft
synths as I need them.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/studio-bank-editor.png" NAME="Graphic4" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=356 HEIGHT=340 BORDER=0></P>
<H4>Loading a Stock Set of Programs</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">If you're
lucky, the growing Rosegarden Library already contains a set of bank
and program definitions to suit your hardware. To try your luck,
click the <B>Import...</B> button. You will initially be presented
with a list of <B>.rgd</B> files from the Library, which was
installed along with Rosegarden itself, but you can, of course,
browse to other locations. You can import banks from both regular
Rosegarden Composition (<B>.rg)</B> files, and from Rosegarden
Definition (<B>.rgd)</B> files. If you don't find anything suitable,
you will probably have to start from scratch, as I will explain later
on.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">Stepping
back, let us assume for a moment that my &quot;Soft Synth 2&quot; is
either QSynth or it's really an SB Live!. The quick and dirty way to
fill up this list of programs is to load them directly from the
soundfont, from the <B>.sf2</B> file. Simply set the &quot;Filter:&quot;
to &quot;Soundfont&quot; and browse to the location of the soundfont
you've loaded into your synth.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/studio-import-soundfont.png" NAME="Graphic9" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=356 HEIGHT=211 BORDER=0>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">Regardless
of your selection, after you have chosen to import programs from a
file, After you've selected an <B>.rgd, .rg, </B>or <B>.sf2</B> file
from somewhere, you'll be presented with a dialog like this:

<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/studio-import-options.png" NAME="Graphic8" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=196 HEIGHT=124 BORDER=0></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">If the
file contains models of more than one device, you can choose which
one to import. You also have various choices about which bits to
import, and whether to merge new banks into existing ones or replace
them completely.</P>
<H3><A NAME="2_5_4"></A>Creating a List of Programs from Scratch</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
If none of the device models in the library are suitable, and you
can't load the program names out of a soundfont, you can use an
existing file from the library as a starting point, or you can create
a new instrument definition completely from scratch.</P>
<H4>Naming the Device</H4>
<P>So that you can avoid confusion, you probably want to replace
Rosegarden's default &quot;Anonymous MIDI Device 3&quot; type name
with something more meaningful. Simply double click on the existing
name and give your virtual model a more descriptive one.</P>
<P>Now that your &quot;Anonymous External Device&quot; has become a
&quot;Roland SC-33&quot; or what have you, you probably want add a
description of its available programs and controllers to Rosegarden's
model.</P>
<H4>Why Name Programs and Controllers?</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
Depending on the capabilities of this device, it might not matter
whether you define named program changes or not. However, if you do
intend to transmit programs, bank changes or controllers to the
equipment--even if you only want to use numbers--you need to define
<I>something </I>here. Rosegarden's model of your equipment will only
include what you define here, and anything you leave empty will not
be available for your use. If you don't let Rosegarden know that
program number 97 can play something, it will never allow you set a
track to use that program number.</P>
<H4>Gathering Information</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
The key to success here is having as much information about the
equipment as possible. You need to know what programs it can use, and
how the banks are numbered. If you have no idea, you may have to try
loading &quot;raw-numbers.rgd&quot; from the Library, which I created
as a way of providing a generic everything to everyone placeholder
just to fill up the slots and allow program changes to be
transmitted. Beyond the essential fact that you must understand your
equipment to describe it, there are really only two special cases
worth mentioning here.</P>
<H4>Variations</H4>
<P>Some equipment uses a method of sorting programs into banks in
such a way that the programs in bank 0 0 are the standard General
MIDI instruments, and the programs in the remaining banks are
variations on those instruments. Roland's GS standard is a prime
example of this. Bank 0 0, program 1 is &quot;Piano 1&quot; and bank
0 8, program 1 is &quot;Piano 1w.&quot; In order to make it easy to
take advantage of this relationship, Rosegarden offers the ability to
display programs in secondary banks as variations. You may choose to
enable this, and to show the variation list based on either the LSB
or MSB value.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/studio-variations.png" NAME="Graphic6" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=261 HEIGHT=52 BORDER=0></P>
<H4>The Percussion Checkbox</H4>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
Finally, you may have noticed that Rosegarden only allows you one set
of program changes per bank address. The exception to this rule is
that you may define a parallel set of program changes if the [x]
Percussion box is checked. For example, if you have a synth that
interprets standard program changes in bank 0 0 on channel 10 as drum
kit changes (like GS) then you can tell Rosegarden how to use them.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
The process is a bit fiddly. First you have to use the <B>Add </B>button
to create a new, empty bank. It will take a number other than 0 0
because 0 0 is already in use. Check the [x] Percussion box for this
new bank, and then dial its LSB and MSB values back down to 0 0 (or
wherever they need to be for your implementation) and enter the names
of drum kits as programs.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/studio-percussion-box.png" NAME="Graphic7" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=227 HEIGHT=47 BORDER=0></P>
<H4>Send in Your Device Descriptions</H4>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
Once you've defined the names for your program changes, you can save
the device definition to disk with the <B>Export... </B>button.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">If you
think anyone else might benefit from having the instrument
definition, you can mail it to me at<A HREF="mailto:mmcintyr@swva.net">
<B>dmmcintyr@users.sourceforge.net</B></A> and I will add it to our
growing collection of user contributions.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
New contributions are most welcome. We pioneers must do all the work
so that future generations can be lazy. Just remember that I had to
do the SC-33 device from scratch too, and it was very tedious and
time-consuming. Especially since this stuff was a lot more buggy and
incomprehensible back then. ;)</P>
<H2>Custom Controllers</H2>
<P>Rosegarden should create a few basic default controllers for you.
If you have special requirements, or if some of these controllers
don't function on the piece of equipment for which you're defining
the device, you may wish to edit these defaults by clicking the
<B>Control Events</B> button.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/control-events.png" NAME="Graphic2" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=345 HEIGHT=259 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>If your equipment can't use any of these controllers,
you probably want to delete them. If there are controllers missing,
you can add them one by one. Use the <B>Add</B> button. This will
create a new entry using default values. Double click it, and you
should be presented with a dialog similar to this one.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/studio-controller-editor.png" NAME="Graphic10" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=273 HEIGHT=228 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">Most of these parameters
should be obvious to you based on the particular needs of the
equipment you're describing, but the last two bear special mention.
The <B>Color: </B>parameter is the color this controller's knob will
have on the <B>Instrument Parameters Box</B> in the main window, and
the <B>position:</B> determines whether this controller will show up,
and how it will be arranged relative to the other controllers. 
</P>
<H2>Default Document Properties</H2>
<P>Before you make this document your default, you might want to have
a look at some other document-specific settings. These aren't a part
of the Studio, but they're saved in <B>autoload.rg</B>, and any new
documents you create will start life with these defaults. To edit
them, use <B>Composition -&gt; Edit -&gt; Document Properties</B>.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/document-properties.png" NAME="Graphic3" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=339 HEIGHT=186 BORDER=0></P>
<H3>Lilypond Headers</H3>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">The About tab starts off
with some default properties. You can modify or delete these, and you
can add new properties. The four defaults will be translated into
Lilypond during an export. If you wish to use any other strings in
your Lilypond headers, you can add them here by creating properties
of that name, then binding your custom strings with them.. For
example, &quot;instrument,&quot; &quot;dedication,&quot; or &quot;poet.&quot;</P>
<H3>Audio Directory</H3>
<P>From the Audio tab, you can configure a new directory for audio
files. Rosegarden will use this path for recording new files, and
it's the first place it will look when you import audio segments. By
default, this is ~/rosegarden. If this path doesn't exist, you won't
be able to record audio, so either create that directory or configure
Rosegarden to look somewhere else here.</P>
<P>You should get in the habit of creating a new audio directory for
each document you create in which you intend to use audio segments,
as I will detail in another chapter.</P>
<H3>Custom Colors</H3>
<P>Rosegarden can colorize segments and controllers. Custom colors
are defined here.</P>
<H2><A NAME="2_5_5"></A>Saving Your Studio as the Default</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">Now that
you've gotten your studio configured, you'll want to make it your
default, so that you can avoid having to go through this entire
ordeal every time you start a new composition. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in"><B>Composition
-&gt; Studio -&gt; Save Current Document as Default Studio</B> will
save the current document as your local <B>autoload.rg</B> file. This
becomes the default for all new documents you create, but again, it
will have no effect on documents that you've already created.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
This default studio is just like any ordinary <B>.rg</B> file, and
that means any segments, track labels, instrument assignments, etc.
that you have in the current document will be saved, and will
subsequently be loaded each time you create a new document.</P>
