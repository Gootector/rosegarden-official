<H1>Producing Sound (final)</H1>
<P>Many users have written to ask why they are unable to get
Rosegarden to make any noise. It is the most common question asked on
the rosegarden-user mailing list by far, and is especially
troublesome for those newly migrating to Linux from Windows. Before
we start Rosegarden for the first time, I want to explain what is
necessary to pave the way, and have a good first experience. Some of
you already know all this, and those of you who do are invited to
jump ahead to the next chapter, where the interesting part begins.</P>
<P>The topic of sound covers two distinct areas that may or may not
be codependent, depending on the hardware and software you have
available. One the one hand, there are several requirements that must
be met in order to play MIDI with Rosegarden, and on the other, it's
necessary to get the JACK server up and running reliably in order to
make use of Rosegarden's audio features. A working JACK server is
also required to play MIDI with synth plugins, or to play more than
one ALSA software synth at a time. Getting Rosegarden to make noise
can be a complicated business, but hopefully I can help you deal with
whatever set of circumstances you have before you. I cannot, however,
cover every detail of getting every card working with every
distribution. I'm afraid I have to leave some questions unanswered,
lest this chapter become a book unto itself. 
</P>
<P>Here is a roadmap showing all the possible ways to produce sound
with Rosegarden at a glance. It's quite daunting, I know, but I hope
I can help you make sense of it:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/sound-diagram-master.jpg" NAME="Graphic16" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=532 HEIGHT=518 BORDER=0></P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Playing MIDI</H2>
<P>MIDI under Linux is quite a complicated subject. The available
hardware falls into three broad categories, each with its own special
considerations. <FONT COLOR="#0000ff">External MIDI hardware</FONT>,
<FONT COLOR="#5c8526">internal hardware with ALSA support</FONT>, and
internal hardware without ALSA support. The latter category splits
into <FONT COLOR="#9966cc">ALSA soft synths</FONT> and <FONT COLOR="#5e11a6">synth
plugins</FONT>, which are similar, but slightly different.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">What's in My Computer?</H3>
<P>If you have no idea what you have inside your box, and you have no
idea how to configure any of this stuff, one good place to start is
to have a look and see how far your distro has gotten you for free.
Most modern distros should load ALSA over OSS (the old sound system),
and they should detect and configure a wide variety of soundcards for
you automatically. KDE has a useful information center that can
display information about your sound configuration. It will typically
be found on the KDE menu under <B>System -&gt; Info Center</B>, or
you can run it manually by typing &quot;kinfocenter&quot; into an
alt+F2 run command box.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Here is a sample of its output, with
explanations superimposed on the screenshot:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/sound-kinfocenter.png" NAME="Graphic1" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=418 HEIGHT=344 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">Different soundcards will
have different features. Most of them, for example, will list nothing
for &quot;Synth devices.&quot;</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">External MIDI Interfaces</H3>
<P>By far the least complicated, and most expensive way to play MIDI
under Linux is to use real MIDI equipment. This can include
keyboards, sound modules, and perhaps even MIDI guitars. A wide range
of equipment is available for this purpose, ranging from
comparatively inexpensive consumer keyboards to professional quality
gear. The cost ranges from hundreds to thousands of dollars however,
and this is not the way to go unless you are serious about MIDI.</P>
<P>If you're fortunate enough to have such equipment, then you
probably already have some idea how to hook it up to your computer.
If the equipment has the ability to produce sound on its own, as some
MIDI keyboards do, then you may wish to use those speakers for MIDI
playback. If your MIDI equipment has no speakers, or if you intend to
record the audio output from this equipment, you may wish to connect
the audio output from your keyboard or sound module to an audio input
jack on your soundcard. This will allow you to route everything
through the <FONT COLOR="#ff8080">soundcard's mixer</FONT>. There are
several choices for external MIDI interfaces.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Joystick Port MIDI Adapters</H4>
<P>The simplest, least expensive route is the joystick port MIDI
adapter. These are found on many common, low-end soundcards, such as
the Sound Blaster PCI 128 (snd-ens1371). It can be somewhat difficult
to obtain a suitable Y-cable or MIDI box to connect to these, and you
will probably have to procure one online. With the right adapter in
hand, all that remains is to connect your equipment to the box or
cable using standard 5-pin DIN MIDI cables. With the snd-ens1371
driver, and those for many similar cards, it's only a matter of
making sure the <FONT FACE="Courier 10 Pitch">snd-seq-midi</FONT> and
<FONT FACE="Courier 10 Pitch">snd-rawmidi</FONT> modules are loaded
(using whatever mechanism your particular distribution provides for
that function.)</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">USB MIDI</H4>
<P>USB is supplanting traditional MIDI cabling, and several
manufacturers are producing keyboards that plug directly into your
computer using standard USB cables. There are also devices available
which provide multi-port MIDI interfaces. These interfaces attach to
your computer using a USB cable, and they provide several traditional
5-pin MIDI sockets.</P>
<H5 CLASS="western">USB Keyboards</H5>
<P><A HREF="http://www.evolution.co.uk/">Evolution</A> manufactures
several models that are known to conform to the standard USB MIDI
specification, which are therefore compatible with Linux. Chris
Cannam, one of the core Rosegarden developers, uses an Evolution-2
keyboard, and reports that it works using the <FONT FACE="Courier 10 Pitch">snd-usb-audio</FONT>
module, which should probably be loaded automatically by hotplug. He
imagines that most other manufacturers' wares are similar.</P>
<H5 CLASS="western">USB MIDI Interfaces</H5>
<P>The Edriol UM-2 and mAudio MidiSport 2x2 are known to work under
Linux. I have no experience with such things myself, I'm afraid, so I
can only provide second-hand information.</P>
<P>Pedro Lopez-Cabanillas, a contributing Rosegarden developer,
reports that getting the Edriol UM-2 working is as simple as plugging
in the USB cable and loading the <FONT FACE="Courier 10 Pitch">snd-usb-audio</FONT>
module, which should probably be loaded automatically by hotplug.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/usbmidi-PLC.jpg" NAME="Graphic2" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=304 HEIGHT=181 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>Pedro's USB MIDI Interfaces...</I></P>
<P>Pedro and Chris both report that the mAudio MidiSport interfaces
are more difficult to get working. Pedro reports that &quot;some of
them require a firmware program to be loaded into the device's RAM
before you can use it. There are GPL firmwares (package ezusbmidi)
for the 1-port and 2-port devices (up to Midisport2x2), they are
provided as RPM packages for Red Hat by <A HREF="http://ccrma.stanford.edu/planetccrma/software/">CCRMA,</A>
and for Mandrake by <A HREF="http://rpm.nyvalls.se/">Thac</A>. There
are also ready to use packages from AGNULA/Debian and Gentoo. Or you
can tweak and compile the firmware from its sources.&quot; Chris
reports that users with 2.6-series kernels may have difficulty using
these devices. Pedro suggests that you have a look at the <A HREF="http://ccrma.stanford.edu/planetccrma/software/usbmidi.html">zero
config environment</A> information available from CCRMA if you are
running Red Hat or Fedora.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">MIDI without External Hardware</H3>
<P>For those without external hardware to use, there are two
remaining categories. A few soundcards have built-in MIDI
infrastructure that ALSA can use. Everyone else will have to use some
kind of software synth.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Cards with Synth Support under ALSA</H4>
<P>This is the next easiest way to get MIDI working. So far as I
know, this category only applies to those with soundcards based on an
Emu chipset, such as the Sound Blaster Live!/Audigy series
(snd-emu10k1), and the AWE 32/64 (snd-emu8000). I have a Sound
Blaster Live! Value Edition myself, and can report that it's easy to
get working, and it sounds reasonably decent.</P>
<H5 CLASS="western">SB Live! Modules</H5>
<P>First, you'll need to ensure you have the proper kernel modules
loaded, and that you are using the ALSA modules, which have &quot;snd&quot;
in the name. If your distro has a nice utility for this purpose, use
it. I have been unable to locate a graphical module-reporting utility
that's universally-available. The only alternative I can give you
that's assured of working across all distros is to head for the
dreaded command line to issue a command like:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.49in"><FONT FACE="Courier 10 Pitch">lspci |
grep snd</FONT></P>
<P>I have the following modules loaded for my own SB Live!:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><FONT FACE="Courier 10 Pitch">snd-seq-oss
snd-seq-midi snd-emu10k1-synth snd-emux-synth </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><FONT FACE="Courier 10 Pitch">snd-seq-midi-emul
snd-seq-virmidi snd-seq-midi-event snd-seq</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><FONT FACE="Courier 10 Pitch">snd-emu10k1
snd-pcm-oss snd-mixer-oss snd-pcm snd-timer</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><FONT FACE="Courier 10 Pitch">snd-hwdep
snd-util-mem snd-page-alloc snd-ac97-codec</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><FONT FACE="Courier 10 Pitch">snd-rawmidi
snd-seq-device snd soundcore</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><I>If you don't see &quot;snd&quot;
you almost certainly have the wrong (OSS, the old sound system)
modules loaded, or no sound modules at all. Addressing that is beyond
the scope of this book, due to there being so many differences
between distros. I fear I have to refer you to whatever help
resources your distro provides in that event. </I></FONT>
</P>
<H5 CLASS="western">Set the Mixer Volume</H5>
<P>Next, you'll need to check to make sure you've turned up your
mixer volumes. I will cover this card's rather complicated mixer in
detail when I talk about managing various inputs and outputs for the
purpose of audio recording. For the moment, it should be sufficient
to ensure the &quot;Music&quot; channel volume is turned up. My mixer
of preference is <A HREF="http://www.suse.de/~mana/kalsatools.html">KAmix</A>.
Unfortunately, it is not widely available outside of SuSE, and you
may have to compile it yourself. (I had to go to quite a lot of
trouble to compile it myself for Debian.) It isn't the prettiest
mixer, but it's the only one I've found that lets me control my SB
Live! consistently and efficiently to get the results I want.</P>
<H5 CLASS="western">Load a SoundFont</H5>
<P>Finally, you'll need to load a soundfont into the card. These
cards use .sf2 soundfonts that are readily available. I'm not aware
of a soundfont free enough to be included with any distribution of
Linux, so you will most likely have to obtain one from the web, or
perhaps from the CDs that came with your soundcard. I have had good
luck with soundfonts from the <A HREF="http://www.personalcopy.com/linuxfiles.htm">Personal
Copy</A> website, but I make no warranty expressed or implied about
the suitability or legality of their soundfonts, or any other
soundfonts you might obtain on the web for any particular purpose.</P>
<P>Once you have obtained a soundfont, you need to load it into the
card. There isn't currently any user-friendly way of managing this.
I'm developing a utility for this very purpose, but I did not have
time to finish it before releasing this book, and so I will make no
further reference to it. In the meantime, your two choices are to run
the command line utility <B><FONT FACE="Courier 10 Pitch">asfxload</FONT></B>,
or to configure Rosegarden to load a soundfont for you at startup,
via <B>Settings -&gt; Configure Rosegarden -&gt; Sequencer -&gt;
General</B></P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/configure-soundfont.png" NAME="Graphic17" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=456 HEIGHT=240 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><BR><BR>
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Cards without Synth Support under ALSA</H4>
<P>This is really the &quot;everything else&quot; category. It
includes too many soundcards to list, each with its own set of
modules. The Sound Blaster PCI and Ensoniq AudioPCI cards (ens-1370,
ens-1371, ens-1373), and integrated snd-intel8x0 and snd-via82xx are
probably the most common, but soundcards that fall into this category
are legion. The process for getting them to play MIDI is similar in
all cases.</P>
<H5 CLASS="western">Check your Modules</H5>
<P>First, you need to ensure you have the necessary ALSA MIDI
infrastructure by loading the following modules in addition to
whatever other modules you require for your particular hardware:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><FONT FACE="Courier 10 Pitch">snd-seq-midi
snd-seq-virmidi snd-seq-midi-event snd-seq</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><FONT FACE="Courier 10 Pitch">snd-timer
snd-rawmidi snd soundcore</FONT></P>
<P><I>(The above list was extrapolated from the previous SB Live!
example, and may contain modules that won't actually load with your
particular hardware. If loading one or more of the above modules
fails, don't worry about it unless you later find your MIDI subsystem
doesn't work.)</I></P>
<H5 CLASS="western">QSynth</H5>
<P>The least complicated way to get one of these cards to play MIDI
is to use <A HREF="http://qsynth.sourceforge.net/">QSynth</A>. It is
a simple to use ALSA soft synth that takes MIDI data as input and
uses <B>.sf2</B> format soundfonts to produce audio output. In its
simplest configuration, it can use ALSA for audio output, avoiding
the need to run JACK. If you already need or want to run JACK, it can
connect its output to JACK instead. In this configuration, you can
also use a variety of other ALSA soft synths such as <A HREF="http://hydrogen.sourceforge.net/">Hydrogen</A>
and <A HREF="http://zynaddsubfx.sourceforge.net/">ZynAddSubFX</A>,
all sharing the same audio output. QSynth is the most useful for
general music production, and so it is my focus here.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/qsynth-main.png" NAME="Graphic19" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=532 HEIGHT=117 BORDER=0></P>
<H6 CLASS="western">Configure the Audio Driver</H6>
<P>The first decision you need to make is whether to use ALSA or JACK
for output. I will cover starting and configuring JACK in detail in a
moment. No matter which option you choose, both are configured via
the <B>Setup</B> button. In this example, I'm using JACK. Take
special note that I have adjusted the sample rate to match the sample
rate I'm using with JACK, which is 48,000 Hz (for reasons I will
explain directly.) Also note that I have checked <B>[x] Auto Connect
JACK Outputs</B>. This allows QSynth to make its own default
connection with JACK, which is very convenient.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/qsynth-audio-setup.png" NAME="Graphic18" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=418 HEIGHT=269 BORDER=0></P>
<H6 CLASS="western">Loading a SoundFont</H6>
<P>Finally, it's necessary to load at least one soundfont. These are
the same <B>.sf2</B> soundfonts used by the SB Live! series of cards,
and they are loaded via a different tab on the same setup page.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/qsynth-soundfonts.png" NAME="Graphic20" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=418 HEIGHT=270 BORDER=0></P>
<H5 CLASS="western">SynthPlugins</H5>
<P>It is also possible to play using synth plugins. There is a
FluidSynth-DSSI plugin that provides essentially the same
functionality as QSynth, except that it's integrated directly into
Rosegarden. I will describe it in detail when I talk about assigning
instruments to tracks, because its configuration and use is entirely
internal to Rosegarden. For the moment it is sufficient to know that
it exists, and that it requires a working JACK server in order to
function.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Playing Audio</H2>
<P>In order to play audio you will need to run JACK. 
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">What is JACK?</H3>
<P>JACK is short for the &ldquo;Jack Audio Connection Kit.&rdquo;
JACK is a flexible audio server that allows its client applications
to share the audio hardware seamlessly, and to share a common
transport. It provides flexible mechanisms for routing inputs and
outputs to and from client applications using a jack-and-cable
metaphor. It is geared toward the audio professional who wants to get
the lowest possible latency and the best possible performance out of
his or her hardware, but professional or not, it's something you need
to come to terms with JACK if you want to play audio with Rosegarden.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Obtaining a Suitable Kernel</H3>
<P>It is theoretically possible to run JACK and Rosegarden with an
ordinary kernel, but I have never obtained acceptable results, even
on machine with fairly high specs. CPU power and abundant RAM are
insufficient to guarantee reliable performance, and you will,
unfortunately, need to run a specialized kernel. Fortunately, the
likes of <A HREF="http://www.agnula.org/">AGNULA</A> make it much
easier than it used to be. It is now possible to do quality audio
work in Linux without having to become an expert kernel hacker. I
have to admit that I was impressed with this when I finally came
around to trying it for myself. If you read any of the pre-release
versions of this book, you may remember various rants I wrote about
Linux audio along the way. I can now report that a happy JACK can be
as simple as downloading one of AGNULA's (or CCRMA's presumably)
kernels, installing it, and rebooting. The particular vagaries of
installing the kernel are beyond the scope of this book, but I am
running with these packages on my Debian box (laptop users might need
to snag the PCMCIA modules as well):</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.49in"><FONT FACE="Courier 10 Pitch">alsa-modules-2.4.25-1-multimedia-686</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.49in"><FONT FACE="Courier 10 Pitch">kernel-image-2.4.25-1-multimedia-686</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I>NOTE: Your mileage may vary if you
want to use a newer 2.6-series kernel. As of this writing, they are
still rather immature and experimental, and I am not using one, so I
can't very well write about it.</I></FONT></P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Starting and Tweaking JACK</H3>
<P>The simplest way to control your JACK server is to use <A HREF="http://qjackctl.sourceforge.net/"><FONT FACE="Courier 10 Pitch">qjackctl</FONT></A>.
It is a very useful utility that provides a convenient way to start
and stop your JACK server, to play with various configuration
parameters to find the best combination for your hardware, and to
manage JACK connections between applications.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/qjackctl-overview.png" NAME="Graphic21" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=456 HEIGHT=90 BORDER=0></P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Configuring the JACK Server</H3>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">To change how your JACK
server is configured, use the <B>Setup</B> button. The process that
follows will probably be tedious and time-consuming, but once you
have discovered the &quot;magic numbers&quot; for your hardware,
everything should continue to work thereafter. The patched kernel you
installed allows JACK to have higher than normal priority, and this
requires root privileges. You should configure JACK to start using
&quot;jackstart&quot; so that you can run Rosegarden and JACK as an
ordinary user. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/qjackctl-silvan.png" NAME="Graphic25" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=494 HEIGHT=359 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">The settings displayed are
those that work best for me on my Sound Blaster Live!, and you may
well have some fiddling to do from here. Discovering the best
combination is a process of playing with the &quot;Frames/Period&quot;,
&quot;Sample Rate&quot; and &quot;Periods/Buffer&quot; settings. Your
objective here is to find the lowest possible latency, as reported in
the lower right-hand corner of the dialog. As you change settings,
this number will show the results yielded by that combination. You
want the sample rate high, and the frames/periods and periods/buffer
low.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">I suggest you dial up the
lowest possible latency, click on <B>OK</B>, then try to start the
JACK server with the <B>Start</B> button on the main dialog. If the
server fails to start, come back to this dialog and keep working up,
one setting at a time, until you find a combination that works.  Many
combinations of settings will probably cause JACK to fail
immediately.  You should quickly begin to get an idea of the range of
possible values you can use that will actually work, and then you can
home in on the ideal settings from there.  (For example, it isn't
possible to start JACK on my hardware with a periods/buffer other
than two, so there is nothing for it but to use that setting and move
on to a different parameter.)</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">The Evil XRUN</H4>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">It's very important to
avoid xruns. If you find a combination of low-latency settings that
allow the JACK server to start, but which produce a flood of xruns,
you're aiming too high. Xruns are reported in the main QJackCtl
dialog. Ideally, you should see this:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/JACK-no-xruns.png" NAME="Graphic22" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=112 HEIGHT=69 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">If, on the other hand, you
see something like this, you have trouble ahead:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/JACK-know-xruns.png" NAME="Graphic23" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=113 HEIGHT=64 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">You never want to see this
much red. Seeing any red at all is really unacceptable, but you can
probably get by so long as your xruns are few and far between. Xruns
cause audio dropouts; clicks, pops, distortions, flanger-like
effects. If you get more than two or three in the course of a day,
you probably need to de-tune JACK a notch and trade some performance
for reliability.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Managing JACK Connections</H3>
<P>Rosegarden will establish sane default connections automatically.
So will QSynth and Hydrogen, if you've configured them to do so.
ZynAddSubFX and perhaps other JACK-aware applications do not do this.
To see and change the connections, click on the <B>Connections</B>
button. Making or breaking connections is a process of highlighting
one or more items in the left pane and one or more items in the right
pane, then using the <B>Connect</B> or <B>Disconnect</B> buttons as
required.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/qjackctl-connections.png" NAME="Graphic26" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=532 HEIGHT=306 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium"><I>NOTE: You can also use
QJackCtl to manage ALSA MIDI connections. I do not recommend that you
do so while you are running Rosegarden. Rosegarden has its own
internal MIDI router, and it doesn't work properly if you change MIDI
connections externally. However, if, for example, you want to play
your Sound Blaster Live! or QSynth with your MIDI keyboard without
running Rosegarden, you can use QJackCtl's MIDI connection manager to
hook it up.</I></P>
