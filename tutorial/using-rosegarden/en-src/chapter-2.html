	<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	Let's begin by starting Rosegarden, and having a look at the main
	window. This is where you get an overall view of your composition,
	and control a number of settings and parameters.</P>
	<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	A Rosegarden document is called a composition. The main window is
	primarily about editing at the composition level, so most of these
	tools affect your document in a broad way. This is where you name
	and assign instruments to tracks, create and manipulate segments,
	and watch a broad overview of playback. This is also where you
	configure segment parameters such as label and color. While it might
	be more intuitive for you as a composer to change tempo and time
	signature settings from within a notation view, these settings
	actually exist at a composition level, and they may be edited here
	in the main window using the tempo ruler.</P>

	Special Toolbars</H2>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">One of
	the first things you might notice about Rosegarden is that there are
	several toolbars at the top of the main window. In addition to the

	<I>TIP: If your Zoom Slider is cut off by a toolbar, try dragging it
	within your toolbar palette until it's the last item on the right.
	This is a known issue, but seems to be a greater QT/KDE problem, and
	there's not much the Rosegarden developers can do to avoid it.
	Luckily, it's very easy to remedy, and your toolbar settings will be
	remembered the next time you start Rosegarden.</I></P>

	Segments and Parameters</H2>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">Rosegarden
	compositions are made up of segments, and editing at the composition
	level involves dragging them around and rearranging them. Segments
	are a universal container that may hold either MIDI events or audio
	data. Segments are rather similar to layers in an image editing
	program such as the GIMP. They can be cut, pasted, split,
	re-combined, overlapped and pretty much rearranged at will, and are
	very flexible. While there are understandably some differences in
	the way these two types of segments behave, they can be manipulated
	in almost exactly the same way within the composition. The only real
	limitation is that audio segments and MIDI segments cannot both play
	in the same track.</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">Unless
	you began with an imported MIDI file, your segment canvas will be
	empty, and many of the features I wish to demonstrate will be
	disabled.</P>

	You can begin recording (audio or MIDI) to create one, but I'll get
	into that a bit later. For now, why not draw one from scratch?</P>

	<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
	<I>NOTE: As of this writing, when 1.0 is still spoken of in the

	This can also merge events from several different tracks into a

	MIDI and audio into the same segment.</P>
	<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	You can get some sense of what that bit of music is like just by

	dragging things around. If this feature is not turned on, turn it on
	with<B> Settings -&gt; Segment Previews</B>. This displays a
	miniature &ldquo;piano roll&rdquo; for MIDI segments, and a drawing

	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">

	While you can't grab it and move it around directly, you can
	position it any arbitrary point in the composition by clicking along
	the dark gray portion of the ruler at the top, or you can use the

	<H3>The Transport</H3>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">

	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">Of

	<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
	The p<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"--> anic button transmits a

	that low F# is driving you up the wall.</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
	The metronome does what you'd probably expect. You can turn the
	metronome on during normal playback, as well as recording, and it is
	a useful tool to use when practicing playing along with your
	composition.  Configure it via <B>Studio -&gt; Manage Metronome</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">.</SPAN></P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
	The solo button mutes all tracks except for the one that's currently
	selected, allowing you a convenient way to hear just one part. (To
	&quot;solo&quot; more than one part, at present, you'll need to set
	the mute for tracks individually. The solo button only affects a
	single track.)</P>
	<H2>Time and Tempo</H2>
	<P>As I mentioned, the time signature and tempo are global to the

	can manipulate both time signature and tempo to your heart's content
	from the main window.</P>
	<P>The tempo ruler changes color to indicate changes in tempo.  When
	a change occurs, the tempo is displayed along the top half of the
	ruler, and the time signature is displayed across the bottom.  If
	you double click this ruler, the Tempo and Time Signature editor
	will appear.</P>

	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
	I'll conclude this section by mentioning a very useful feature that
	doesn't quite fit in anywhere else. As always, &quot;save early,
	save often&quot; is the mantra of computer users everywhere, and
	can't be stressed enough. It's never a bad idea to take time out to
	save your work.</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
	However, Rosegarden attempts to save you from yourself.</P>
	<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
	If the GUI crashes for some reason, or you have a power outage or
	the like, the next time you start Rosegarden and attempt to load the
	file you were working on, you'll be presented with the option of
	loading the autosave file instead. If you hadn't yet saved the file,
	you'll find it in your ~/autosave directory with a basic name of
	&quot;untitled.&quot;</P>
	<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">
	The autosave interval defaults to 60 seconds. Configure it via the
