<H1>Appendix A: MIDI Primer (final)</H1>
<P>MIDI stands for Musical Instrument Digital Interface. It is a
simple serial protocol that electronic instruments and computers can
use to talk to each other. MIDI-capable instruments vary enormously
in their capabilities and complexity, ranging from simple analog
synthesizers to pipe organs to electronic guitars, and even to
electronic woodwinds and brass instruments.</P>
<P>MIDI-capable instruments aren't required to have much in common,
but there are a several categories of characteristics that most of
them share.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Channels</H2>
<P>If you have a cable TV, you can receive more than one television
channel over the same wire. MIDI channels behave in a similar
fashion. Any one MIDI cable can be used to carry up to 16 channels of
information. Most common modern equipment is capable of receiving on
all 16 of these channels simultaneously, and many types of equipment
can also transmit on more than one channel.</P>
<P>These channels work something like the tracks in Rosegarden, which
is why channel assignment is done at the track level (through
instruments). If you set the reverb level for channel 3, this setting
will (typically) only affect notes that are transmitted on channel 3.
Channels are similarly useful for playing different instruments at
the same time, over the same cable, or for playing using different
voices on a single instrument.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Programs</H2>
<P>Most common MIDI instruments are polyphonic and multi-timbral.
This means that they can play more than one note at the same time,
and they can play notes using different voices. Many instruments try
to simulate a proverbial band-in-a-box by offering a range of sounds
ranging from piano through the orchestra into synthesized and ethnic
sounds. These simulated instruments are called either &quot;programs&quot;
or &quot;patches.&quot;</P>
<P>In the most common MIDI standard, General MIDI (GM), instruments
must be able to play using any of 127 different programs. Music
written to be performed on one GM instrument should sound similar on
any other. The GM specification dictates that channel 10 will play
drum sounds, and it defines a standard arrangement of keys on the
keyboard to represent different drums.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Banks</H2>
<P>Beyond the GM standard, many instruments have banks of additional
programs. Each bank can contain an additional 127 programs. The MIDI
specification allows for a monumental number of different banks, but
most instruments arrange banks in two common ways. The two most
common standards for this expansion of GM are called GS (Roland) and
XG (Yamaha.) The usual General MIDI programs are in the first bank,
and the extra programs are found in additional banks. Each bank has a
unique identifying number using a combination of two parameters. They
are Least Significant Byte (LSB) and Most Significant Byte (MSB). The
standard GM bank on every GM-compliant synth has an LSB/MSB address
of 0 0.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Controllers</H2>
<P>MIDI allows for 127 controllers. These controllers typically work
at a channel level, and are used to control things such as pan (how
far to the left or right the sound will play), volume (the overall
maximum volume for the channel), pitch bend (used to simulate guitar
and harmonica bends, play quarter tones, as well as numerous other
uses), reverb (makes notes on the channel sound like they're in a
concert hall) and sustain (causes the note to keep playing unhampered
until the sound finally dies away, like the sustain pedal on a
piano). There is enormous variability in this area, and you will find
some equipment that ignores them all, while other instruments will
use nearly all 127 of them. You will need to know what kind of
controllers your equipment (or software synth) supports if you are to
configure Rosegarden to make use of them, though it does come out of
the box aware of a very limited subset of the most common
controllers.</P>
