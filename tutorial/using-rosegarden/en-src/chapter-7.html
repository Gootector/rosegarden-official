<H1><A NAME="6"></A>You Don't Know JACK</H1>
<P>In order to make use of Rosegarden's audio features, you will need
to run JACK.</P>
<P>JACK is short for the &ldquo;Jack Audio Connection Kit.&rdquo;
This marvel is at the heart of Linux audio, and it allows for a level
of interoperability between applications that's undreamt of in the
world of proprietary software.  JACK is a flexible audio server that
allows its client applications to share the audio hardware
seamlessly, regardless of the sound driver used, and to share a
common transport.  It is geared toward the audio professional who
wants to get the lowest possible latency and the best possible
performance out of his or her hardware.  The good news is that it
works even if you're not a serious audio professional, and are too
stupid to understand most of the concepts involved.  Like me.  :)</P>
<H2>Starting and tweaking JACK</H2>
<P>The simplest way to control your JACK server is to use <B>qjackctl</B>.
It takes a lot of the sting out of the process, and presents you with
a nice interface to show you how things are going. It is, of course,
not a part of Rosegarden, and you will need to install it separately.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">In the above example, you
see what it's <B>supposed</B> to look like. Sometimes getting it to
play nice is no mean feat. Notice in particular that I am showing 0
(0) where the xruns are reported. xruns are JACK's way of telling you
that it isn't happy. They cause audio dropouts and bad performance.
Your goal in tweaking JACK is to achieve the lowest latency possible
while preventing xruns.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">To change how your JACK
server is configured, use the <B>Setup</B> button. Here you can see
the settings that finally worked for me with my SB Live!. It's
notable that I am running JACK strictly as a user, without real-time
capabilities enabled. If you run JACK with real time turned on,
you'll have to run qjackctl, JACK, and Rosegarden as root, or else
you'll have to run a capabilities-enabled kernel so that you can run
them with root privleges as your user.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium"><I>I think. Actually, I
don't know. If this is wrong, please correct me.</I></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">If you were running
Rosegarden before starting JACK, you'll need to close Rosegarden and
restart it in order to make its audio features available. I will
cover the actual use of Rosegarden's features in Chapter 8. For now
we are only concerned with how to get Rosegarden to cooperate with
other JACK-enabled applications.</P>
<H2>Using Rosegarden with a JACK-enabled Soft Synth</H2>
<P>Now that JACK is running and Rosegarden has hopefully set up some
default JACK connections for you, you can take advantage of
Rosegarden's ability to record and play audio.</P>
