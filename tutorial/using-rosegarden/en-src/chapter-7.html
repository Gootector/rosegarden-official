<H1><A NAME="6"></A>You Don't Know JACK</H1>
<P>In order to make use of Rosegarden's audio features, you will need
to run JACK. 
</P>
<P>JACK is short for the &ldquo;Jack Audio Connection Kit.&rdquo;
This marvel is at the heart of Linux audio, and it allows for a level
of interoperability between applications that's undreamt of in the
world of proprietary software.  JACK is a flexible audio server that
allows its client applications to share the audio hardware
seamlessly, regardless of the sound driver used, and to share a
common transport.  It is geared toward the audio professional who
wants to get the lowest possible latency and the best possible
performance out of his or her hardware.  The good news is that
regular dumb kids like me can sometimes get this to work too.  :)</P>
<P>I want everyone to know up front that I am not a Linux audio
hacker.  I don't know how to get the ultimate low latency performance
out of my equipment, and I can't tell you how to take advantage of
any of JACK's more exotic capabilities.  If I can run as many JACK
applications as I want, and play as many streams of audio as I want
without dropouts and distortions,  I feel like I have accomplished
enough.  After a great deal of frustration, I finally achieved an
acceptable plateau of understanding, and I'm staying put.  You will
have to turn to some other source if you wish to be lead beyond the
level of understanding I have attained.</P>
<P>Most notably, I am running all of this stuff as a regular user.  I
added the low latency and pre-emptive patches to my kernel, turned on
&quot;capabilities&quot; and then after I booted, I realized I had no
idea what to <B>do</B> with any of that stuff.  I still don't.  I
finally just booted my old, reliable kernel and decided not to
bother.  It gets me by, but I don't get the kind of performance most
people demand.</P>
<H2>Starting and Tweaking JACK</H2>
<P>The simplest way to control your JACK server is to use <B>qjackctl</B>.
It takes a lot of the sting out of the process, and presents you with
a nice interface to show you how things are going. It is, of course,
not a part of Rosegarden, and you will need to install it separately.</P>

<H3>The Evil XRUN</H3>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">In the above example, you
see what it's generally supposed to look like. Sometimes getting it
to play nice is no mean feat. Notice in particular that most elusive
of conditions:  I have no xruns!</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="font-weight: medium"><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/JACK-no-xruns.png" NAME="Graphic3" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=112 HEIGHT=69 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">You don't want to see
anything else show up in this portion of qjackctl's display.  These
&quot;xruns&quot; are JACK's way of telling you that it isn't happy.
They cause audio dropouts and bad performance. Your goal in tweaking
JACK is to achieve the lowest latency possible while preventing
xruns.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">At the other extreme, I
have intentionally started JACK with parameters I know to deliver
poor results, and I have taxed the system by running too many things
at once, playing too many big audio files at the same time, and so
forth.  I produced this hideous outcome in short order:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="font-weight: medium"><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/JACK-know-xruns.png" NAME="Graphic4" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=113 HEIGHT=64 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">You never want to see this
much red.  Seeing any red at all is really unacceptable.</P>
<H3>Configuring the JACK Server</H3>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">To change how your JACK
server is configured, use the <B>Setup</B> button. Here you can see
the settings that finally worked for me with my SB Live!.  These
settings are pure magic.  I've run JACK for days on end without a
single xrun ever.  I hope they work as well for you.  If not, I'm
afraid the best thing for you do is play with the &quot;Frames/Period&quot;,
&quot;Sample Rate&quot; and &quot;Periods/Buffer&quot; settings. 
Start JACK with the <B>Start</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">
button, see how things go, and then stop it and come back to play
with these settings some more</SPAN> until you find the most
acceptable combination.  Watch the &quot;Latency:&quot; figure in the
bottom corner.  You want to keep this as low as possible.  If you
have high latency here, then any software synths that play through
JACK will have horrible playback problems.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">If you were running
Rosegarden before starting JACK, you'll need to close Rosegarden and
restart it in order to make its audio features available. I will
cover Rosegarden's audio features in depth in the next chapter.  For
now we are only concerned with how to get Rosegarden to cooperate
with other JACK-enabled applications.</P>
