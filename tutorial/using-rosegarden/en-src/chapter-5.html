<H1 STYLE="border: none; padding: 0in"><A NAME="5"></A>A Different
View</H1>
<P STYLE="border: none; padding: 0in">So far, we've only looked at
the main window, and have not really edited anything. Rosegarden
provides three different editors, each with its own unique view of
the data. You can view the raw Rosegarden events with the Event List
Editor, you can work with a piano roll metaphor with the Matrix
Editor, or you can see your data as notation with the Notation
Editor. Each of these editors works on a segment level, so you must
have at least one segment selected in order to open one. If you wish
to start with an editor from scratch, you must first create an empty
segment with the pencil tool, as I described in chapter 2, and then
select it.</P>
<H2>The Event List Editor</H2>
<P STYLE="border: none; padding: 0in">Out of the box, the Notation
Editor is the default, but that is a chapter unto itself. For the
moment, let us begin with the simplest of the three. Pick a segment,
and then right click on it. Choose &quot;Open in Event List Editor&quot;
from the resulting context menu.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="border: none; padding: 0in"><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/open-in-event-editor.png" NAME="Graphic1" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=196 HEIGHT=244 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="border: none; padding: 0in">If you've started
with a blank segment, as I did, there's not much to see here:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="border: none; padding: 0in"><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/event-editor.png" NAME="Graphic2" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=358 HEIGHT=227 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="border: none; padding: 0in">The truly brave
among you might want to experiment with creating something entirely
from scratch by clicking on the &quot;New Event&quot; icon. You'll be
presented with a dialog like this that allows you to make your own
event out of whole cloth:</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="border: none; padding: 0in">Explaining its use
is definitely best reserved for the future 500-page deluxe edition of
this book. For the moment, let us move on to something more useful.</P>
<H3>Suggested Uses</H3>
<H4>Inserting a Mid-Composition Program Change</H4>
<H2>The Matrix Editor</H2>
<P>The Matrix editor is based around the familiar piano roll metaphor
you have probably seen in other packages. It is useful for taking a
hands on approach to tweaking notes where their performance is more
important than their visual appearance as notation. I find myself
using the Matrix most often for two main purposes. It's my preferred
method of sequencing percussion parts, and I use it to knock notes
out of precise alignment on purpose; for example, when sequencing
rolled chords in order to make a MIDI guitar sound more credible.</P>
<H3>Special Considerations of Performance vs. Display</H3>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">It is important to note that Rosegarden
is not purely a MIDI sequencer, and at no time can you ever directly
edit raw MIDI events. It stores events using an internal meta format
that includes quite a bit of information about each note.
Rosegarden's events do of course cover the fundamentals of pitch,
velocity and duration, but they also include such attributes as stem
direction, beam state, accidental state, ties, slurs, slashes,
accents and so forth. Of special note, every Rosegarden event
maintains independent duration values for performance and display.
This makes it possible to create a composition that looks good
printed on paper, and yet preserves all of the slight human
imperfections that give a performance its character.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">In version 1.0, the Matrix can only
edit <B>performance</B> attributes. This can create interesting
challenges both for performance and notation. If you are working on a
human performance, and you draw notes to their full length here in
the Matrix, you may damage the character of the performance slightly.
On the other hand, if you draw slightly long or short notes here, or
knock the timing off the grid lines intentionally, you will create
ugly notation in the process. In either case, you can make
adjustments to massage away these differences from the Notation
Editor, as I will explain in the next chapter.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">One particularly
noteworthy side effect of the way Rosegarden stores events is that
tied notes are a series of discrete dashes here on the Matrix. It is
really not possible to determine whether a series of notes at the
same pitch will sound as one note or several without looking at the
affected area from the Notation Editor.</P>
<H3>Overview</H3>
<P>Let's start with an empty segment one measure long, and I'll show
you the basics. Draw your segment, select it, and then right click on
it and choose &quot;Open in Matrix Editor&quot; from the resulting
context menu. You'll see something like this:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-overview.png" NAME="Graphic4" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=477 HEIGHT=371 BORDER=0></P>
<H3>Entering New Notes</H3>
<P>Now let's do a little one bar loop for demonstration purposes.
Just like on the main view, the 
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/using-rosegarden_html_4c452e31.png" NAME="Graphic65" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=27 HEIGHT=26 BORDER=0>
cursor is used to create something new from scratch. In this case, of
course, we're entering a note. Let's pepper this thing with a few
well placed random pitches:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-new-notes.png" NAME="Graphic5" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=128 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>You may have noticed that those came out as quarter
notes. In order to control the default length of new notes, you must
change the grid setting. Let's enter eight 8<SUP>th</SUP> notes.
First dial in the 8<SUP>th</SUP> note on the grid button:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-dial-grid.png" NAME="Graphic6" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=115 HEIGHT=190 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Now new notes you enter will take this duration by
default:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-8th-notes.png" NAME="Graphic7" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=217 HEIGHT=141 BORDER=0></P>
<P>It's obviously a bit tedious, but you can enter an entire
composition this way if you desire.</P>
<H3>Adjusting Existing Notes</H3>
<P>You can move notes around with the 
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-move-cursor.png" NAME="Graphic8" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=27 HEIGHT=29 BORDER=0>
cursor.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-move-notes.png" NAME="Graphic9" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=213 HEIGHT=158 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>You can resize notes with the 
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-resize-cursor.png" NAME="Graphic11" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=29 HEIGHT=26 BORDER=0>
cursor, by clicking on a note and dragging it.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-resize-notes.png" NAME="Graphic10" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=210 HEIGHT=142 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>By default, resize operations snap to grid lines. If
you wish to drag the note to some arbitrary length, do so by holding
the shift key while dragging the note.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-arbitrary-resize.png" NAME="Graphic12" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=212 HEIGHT=113 BORDER=0></P>
<H3>Selecting and Acting on Multiple Notes</H3>
<P>All of these operations can be performed on more than one note at
a time. In order to do so, you need to make a selection. You can use
the 
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-arrow-cursor.png" NAME="Graphic13" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=27 HEIGHT=27 BORDER=0>
cursor to select individual notes one by one while holding down the
shift key.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-select-individual-notes.png" NAME="Graphic14" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=158 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>If you wish to select a broad range of notes, you can
select every note of a given pitch by selecting the arrow cursor and
shift clicking on the individual notes on the piano keyboard. Each
click will select every note of the desired pitch, and you can select
any number of pitches in this fashion.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-select-pitch.png" NAME="Graphic15" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=203 HEIGHT=136 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>It is also possible to select a band or several bands
of notes by sweeping the arrow cursor across the keys while holding
shift.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-sweep-selection.png" NAME="Graphic16" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=205 HEIGHT=138 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Finally, you can use my selection event filter to cull
events from your selection. Start by making a broad selection, and
then click on the filter icon to summon my dialog. You can then dial
in various criteria for the notes you wish to remain selected after
the filter is applied. I will cover various uses for this in more
depth later on, in the Notation chapter.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-event-filter.png" NAME="Graphic17" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=263 HEIGHT=254 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><I>(Yes, <B>my</B> selection event filter. I'm not just
an author, I also pretend to know C++ on occasion. Please do let me
know if you find it useful, or if there's anything you'd like added
to it, or removed from it.)</I></P>
<H3>Velocity</H3>
<P>Velocity is a MIDI parameter that describes how hard a note was
hit on the keyboard or other device. It allows for finer expression
of volume than what can be accomplished merely by adjusting the
volume parameter for the MIDI channel. If you have a velocity
sensitive keyboard, this parameter will be recorded as you play.
Under certain other circumstances, you may end up with events that
have no velocity property at all, or a default velocity of 100.
Regardless of how it did (or didn't) get there, it's a simple matter
to tweak it to suit your needs.</P>
<H4>Showing the Velocity Ruler</H4>
<P>If the events you're editing have velocity properties, you can
edit them with the Velocity Ruler. If it's not visible, turn it on
from the View menu with <B>View -&gt; Show Velocity Property Ruler</B>.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">In this example, all the events have a
velocity of 100, and they show up as orange bars on the ruler.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-default-velocity-ruler.png" NAME="Graphic19" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=214 HEIGHT=266 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">They can be changed by
dragging them up and down, and the bars change colors to reflect
their value. Here I've arranged them so that you can see each bar.
Notice that the notes on the Matrix itself change to reflect these
same colors.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-arranged-velocity.png" NAME="Graphic20" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=167 HEIGHT=112 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium"><I>NOTE: It can indeed be
somewhat tricky to know which note you're adjusting if there are
several notes of the same duration at the same time. I truthfully
have no idea if there is some trick to this to make managing the
process more foolproof. If anyone knows, email me, and I will mention
in the next edition.</I></P>
<H4>What If There's No Velocity Property?</H4>
<P>Sometimes note events are created without velocity properties. In
that case, there will be nothing to see or do on the Velocity Ruler
until you add some velocities. You'll need to select a range of notes
and then use <B>Adjust -&gt; Velocity -&gt; Set Event Velocities</B>
to create some. This presents you with a dialog box that offers you
several different options for how to set these up. The Value ranges
from 0, which is the softest possible key strike, to 127, which is
the most forceful.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-adjust-velocities.png" NAME="Graphic18" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=381 HEIGHT=115 BORDER=0></P>
<H4><BR><BR>
</H4>
<H3>Controllers</H3>
<P>It's possible to transmit controllers from here in the matrix with
the various Control Rulers. Let's add a Modulation ruler. Choose <B>View
-&gt; Add Event Ruler -&gt; Modulation Controller</B> and you should
now have a new tab at the bottom of your Matrix.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-mod-ruler.png" NAME="Graphic21" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=296 HEIGHT=121 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">If you right click on the
ruler you can insert a controller event, or even an entire line of
them.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-mod-ruler-line.png" NAME="Graphic22" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=145 HEIGHT=84 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">In this example, I have
elected to insert a line of controllers. It's impossible to capture X
cursors, and I'm far too lazy to try to draw that little pointing
finger, so I will instead describe what I did. After making the
selection from the menu, the cursor changed to a pointing finger. I
picked a start point with this finger, and continued to hold the
button down while dragging the resulting line up and to the right. 
After I released the button, it produced this line of controllers:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-line-of-mods.png" NAME="Graphic23" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=152 HEIGHT=112 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">You can move individual
controllers up and down, or you can select and move them in groups.
It's rather less obvious than selections elsewhere, but if you look
closely, you can see that selected controller bars are each outlined
in red.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-selected-controllers.png" NAME="Graphic24" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=139 HEIGHT=75 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">If you hold down shift and
drag these up and down as a group, they all move at once.</P>
