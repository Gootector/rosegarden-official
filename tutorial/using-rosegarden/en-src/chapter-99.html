	Have you done something with Rosegarden?  Would you like to share
	your process of creation with the rest of the users?</P>

	I'm looking for people to create short, self-contained
	mini-tutorials describing how they used Rosegarden's features to
	accomplish something interesting.  This whole document has thus far
	been strongly colored by my own experiences, and my own preferences.
	 Everyone approaches a piece of software differently, and I think it
	would be great to feature a variety of different ways of doing real
	work here.</P>

	concept isn't fully-formed, and I haven't yet decided how best to
	integrate them within the framework of &ldquo;Using Rosegarden.&rdquo;
	 Thus far, I haven't had to make any decisions because no one has
	been forthcoming with any material for me to work in.</SPAN></SPAN></P>
