<H1>Appendix B: Addendum</H1>
<H2>My Studio</H2>
<P>I have been surprised at some of the questions I have been asked
since I began writing this document in 2002. I've been doing the
whole PC soundcard thing since the very earliest beginnings of the
technology, and I've been playing with MIDI in one form or another
since the '80s. I had assumed that the archetypal Rosegarden user
would be someone like me. Perhaps someone who grew up using Cakewalk,
or some other high quality MIDI sequencer package, and needed only to
understand how to translate familiar concepts to a new environment.
It seems in retrospect that many of you are new to all of this, and
that you're not quite sure what's even possible when it comes to
setting up your studio. For this reason, I've decided to describe my
own setup in some detail.</P>
<P>Mine is not a pro studio by any stretch of the imagination. I'm
not a pro musician. I just like to play around every once in a blue
moon and have a bit of fun with music. I have an old Sound Canvas, an
old clunky controller keyboard (a FATAR MIDI-72 with broken pitch and
mod wheels), and a new but hardly exciting Sound Blaster Live! that I
bought pretty much so I could experience it and write about it for my
purposes here in this document. It's not much of a studio, but it's
really all I need for the kind of hack amateur work I do.</P>
<H3>My Computer and Software</H3>
<P>I have a 2.0 GHz Pentium 4 with 512 MB of RAM and 80 GB of disk
space. It is the server for my home network of old computers that are
now used as X terminals. Everyone in my family runs KDE, and it's
typical for everyone to leave a session running all the time, so I
usually have four users and four instances of all the various KDE
libs and applications running at any given time.</P>
<P>I run Debian exclusively, and I can't really stand to use anything
else. Debian is my kind of distro in spades. As I write this, I'm
running Sid, but I expect to switch to the new Sarge and run Stable
for a few months. Due to the demands of the fast-paced world of Linux
audio, and the glacial pace at which Debian shoots off stable
releases, I don't imagine I will have the luxury of running a pure
Sarge for very long. I'll have to start using backports, or else go
back to Sid.</P>
<P>Since I'm a developer, I run Rosegarden from CVS. I try to avoid
running anything else from CVS, and I use the latest versions of
support libraries and supplemental applications that Debian has to
offer. Unless I have a strong and immediate need, I tend to wait on
Debian to get around to including or updating something rather than
seeking out the source, or third-party packages. This often means I'm
using a version of KDE one later than everyone else in the world.</P>
<P>As far as software I actually use, I love ZynAddSubFX. It's
<B>awesome</B>. Hydrogen is pretty awesome too, and QSynth is, in my
humble opinion, the best soft synth on the planet. This is not to
belittle all the other offerings out there by any stretch of the
imagination. There's a lot of great stuff in Linuxdom now, and it's
all coming into its own as I write this.</P>
<H3>How I Have it Hooked Up</H3>
<P>The leg bone's connected to the thigh bone, the hip bone's
connected to the... This diagram attempts to explain how I have all
the cabling routed.</P>
<P>At the center of my studio is the SB Live!. I use the on-board
mixer to control the levels on various channels for recording and
playback, and I use the MIDI interface to connect my keyboard to
Rosegarden, and to connect Rosegarden to my Sound Canvas. The audio
mixer output is routed through the orange jack on the card, through a
digtial coaxial cable to a cheap $50 home theater system from
Wal-Mart.</P>
<P>On the internal MIDI side of things, the SB Live! offers four
output ports of 16 channels each, and 64-voice polyphony using
commonly-available soundfonts. It has no effects processor, and no
reverb or chorus, so the voices sound rather flat and lifeless.
However, the flexibility in choosing soundfonts means I can usually
find a reasonably good approximation of whatever instrument I'm
after. On the external MIDI side, my Sound Canvas can receive on 16
channels, and can play a maximum of 28 voices simultaneously. It has
excellent on-board effects, but the instruments are hit or miss. Some
sound quite good, while others are decidedly pitiful.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/my-studio.png" NAME="Graphic1" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=496 HEIGHT=517 BORDER=0></P>
<P>On the audio side, I have a Radio Shack microphone plugged into
the red jack on the SB Live!, and I share the blue jack between the
audio output from my Sound Canvas and the audio output from my
DigiTech RP-200 guitar effects processor. This arrangement is
inconvenient, since I can't play the Sound Canvas through my mixer
while recording the guitar, but it's about all I can do without
buying a real mixer. I rigged a cable once to allow me to use the CD
audio input on the card as an additional input channel, but the RF
noise level on that channel was ghastly, and I scrapped the idea.</P>
<H2>Who Are You? Why Are You Writing This?</H2>
<P>My name is D. Michael McIntyre, but most folks online know me as
Silvan. I have a BA in foreign languages, but my life took an
unexpected turn in my senior year of college, and I found myself in
the position of having to get a job NOW instead of finishing my
education. I was going to do a PhD in linguistics or something, but I
got married and had children instead. That changed my perspective in
life, and killed any desire I had to ever leave my birthplace in
southwestern Virginia. My career choices centered around finding
something that could deliver an acceptable amount of income without
finishing my education, and without having to move to find work. I've
been driving a truck for the last seven years. It's certainly not
what I imagined I'd do when I grew up, but it's a stable profession
with ample employment opportunities, and work is readily available
based close to home. I travel for a living, but my family doesn't
have to move around to chase the next big promotion.</P>
<P>I evolved into being Silvan at around the same time I discovered
Linux. It's a long and boring story, but the Silvan persona developed
as my Linux ability developed. I started off on a non-Linux newsgroup
complaining that Linux was a bunch of &quot;hacked together slapware&quot;
and that people running it were wasting their time with a bunch of
inferior, dead-end junk. I had this opinion even though I hadn't
actually looked at Linux since the days when it was some weird thing
Computer Science hackers at school were passing around on a single
floppy disk. &quot;Why do you want to run UNIX on your PC anyway?
What's the point of that?&quot; I tried to get away from Windows once
by switching to OS/2 Warp, but there were never really any
applications for it. I assumed that Linux would be more of the same,
and that it would be just like that old single floppy version; a
command line where DOS commands didn't work, and not much more.</P>
<P>Someone told me to try it or shut up about it, and he mailed me a
copy of Mandrake 8.1. Silvan was born. I tried it, I liked it, but it
didn't quite work right. Some part of me that had been put to sleep
by too many years of Windows was reawakened with a vengeance. I
quickly evolved from asking stupid questions to answering rather
complicated questions, and I developed a whole brand of Linux newbie
helpfulness around the Silvan brand name. Regulars on
alt.os.linux.mandrake still remember me to this day.</P>
<P>The next step in my evolution came when I posted the fateful
message on the Linux Audio Users list, or LAU. I asked if there were
&quot;any MIDI apps for Linux that don't suck?&quot; I proceded to
flay every project on the planet as not good enough. One thing lead
to another. My Linux mentor slapped me in the head for being such an
unappreciative jerk in public, and Chris Cannam, one of the lead
Rosegarden developers came quickly onto the scene to address my
complaints.</P>
<P>Having thus had my frame of mind altered, we concluded that many
of the issues I whined about were mostly a matter of my not
understanding how to <B>use</B> Rosegarden, rather than it being the
case that Rosegarden was actually as broken and useless as I
perceived it to be. Chris pointed out that the manual was quite
incomplete, and he suggested that someone ought to supplement the
manual with a user-friendly tutorial to show people how to use
Rosegarden on its own terms.</P>
<P><I>Using Rosegarden</I> was born soon thereafter. I presented the
initial draft to them and they added it to the project. Not long
after, I grew weary of waiting for someone else to fix all of the
legitimate and attitude-adjusted problems Rosegarden still had. I put
off looking at the source code for a long time, but I eventually
stepped in to fix some glaring accidental spelling problems with the
Lilypond export. I've been contributing small bits and pieces ever
since, doing mostly scut work that any imbecile could do, but the
real developers are too busy working on fundamental problems to have
much time for such things. I've added icons, toolbars, reorganized
the menu structure, significantly improved the Lilypond export, added
a new event selection filter, fixed the display of accidentals in all
keys in the notation editor by completely rewriting a rather
fundamental and important bit of code from scratch. I've even managed
to fix a bug or two along the way. None of my contributions have been
great, but I've done enough to marginally qualify to call myself a
Rosegarden developer.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">And so it was that from a pair pissy
messages a monumental undertaking was born. I hope you have benefited
from this document, and I hope you have benefited from my
contributions to the larger Rosegarden project and to the greater
Linux community as a whole.</P>
