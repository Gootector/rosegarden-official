<H1>Notation (under heavy construction)</H1>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; font-style: normal"><FONT FACE="Arial">Rosegarden
has what might well be the most capable notation editor ever found in
a MIDI sequencer. Typically, applications which do the best job of
notation are dedicated entirely to that pursuit, and they have very
limited, rudimentary MIDI capabilities. On the other side of that
coin, applications which do the best job as MIDI sequencers often
have extremely poor notation editors. Rosegarden straddles these two
extremes very well, and its notation editor packs quite a surprising
amount of punch.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; font-style: normal"><FONT FACE="Arial">One
of the most striking features is the fact that Rosegarden maintains
both a display duration and a performance duration for every note.
Users typically have to make a hard choice between a human
performance and legible notation. I myself am certainly no stranger
to the practice of maintaining both a quantized and an un-quantized
version of a piece in separate tracks or separate files. Rosegarden
allows you to have the best of both worlds, maintaining legible
notation and human performance within the very same set of events.</FONT></P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Notation Editor Overview</H2>
<P>In order to open the notation editor, you must have at least one
segment available. You can open any number of segments on any number
of tracks simultaneously by selecting the segment or segments you
wish to edit, and then right clicking on one of them and choosing
&quot;Open in Notation Editor&quot; from the context menu.</P>

<P>Additionally, the notation editor is the normal default, so you
can also open it either by pressing <B>Enter</B>, or by double
clicking on a segment. (You can configure this behavior from <B>Settings
-&gt; Configure Rosegarden</B>.)</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-default-editor.png" NAME="Graphic2" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=456 HEIGHT=72 BORDER=0></P>
<P>After you have opened it, you will see something a bit like this. 
Your screen will probably vary somewhat, because this particular
example is in multi-page layout mode.</P>

<H3 CLASS="western">Notation Toolbars</H3>
<P>The notation editor is just bristling with toolbars.</P>
