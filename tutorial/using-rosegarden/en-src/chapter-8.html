<H1>Notation (progressing...)</H1>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; font-style: normal"><FONT FACE="Arial">I
have mentioned elsewhere that Rosegarden is not purely a MIDI
sequencer, and that it is not possible to create or manage raw MIDI
events directly.  Neither is it purely a notation editor. 
Applications dedicated to notation typically work with notation
internally, and any MIDI performance capability they have is the
result of interpreting that notation and translating it into MIDI. 
These applications typically do a rudimentary job at best, and the
results almost always sound very artificial and mechanical.  At the
other extreme, applications dedicated entirely to MIDI sequencing
tend to have rudimentary notation capabilities, and it is often all
but impossible to produce legible notation with these unless the MIDI
data itself has been beaten into a state of mechanical purity that
causes the results to sound just as artificial as that produced by
dedicated notation packages.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; font-style: normal"><FONT FACE="Arial">Rosegarden
sits squarely in the middle between these two extremes, possessing
most of the features of both, with few compromises.  In order to
allow the richness of a human performance to coexist with legible
notation, every note event, whether recorded, imported, or entered by
hand,  contains not one, but two different duration properties.  One
duration is used to determine how long the note will sound for MIDI
performance, while the other is used for displaying clean, legible
notation.  This exciting feature makes Rosegarden the only
application I know that allows you to have your cake and eat it too.</FONT></P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Notation Editor Overview</H2>
<P>In order to open the notation editor, you must have at least one
segment available. You can open any number of segments on any number
of tracks simultaneously by selecting the segment or segments you
wish to edit, and then right clicking on one of them and choosing
&quot;Open in Notation Editor&quot; from the context menu.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-open-in-notation-editor.png" NAME="Graphic1" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=190 HEIGHT=213 BORDER=0></P>
<P>Additionally, the notation editor is the normal default, so you
can also open it either by pressing <B>Enter</B>, or by double
clicking on a segment. (You can configure this behavior from <B>Settings
-&gt; Configure Rosegarden</B>.)</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-default-editor.png" NAME="Graphic2" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=456 HEIGHT=72 BORDER=0></P>
<P>After you have opened it, you will see something a bit like this.
Your screen will probably look somewhat different, because this
particular example is in multiple page layout mode, which is not the
default.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-overview.png" NAME="Graphic3" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=532 HEIGHT=351 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><I>(I should have done this initial screenshot in the
default, linear layout mode, but I chose this mode instead so I could
showcase my favorite piece.  This obscure, rarely-performed concerto
has gotten me through some trying times, and I love it like no
other.)</I></P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Notation Toolbars</H3>
<P>The notation editor is just bristling with toolbars big and small.
 I will defer many of them until time to describe their function in
more detail.</P>
<P>The standard toolbar includes print and save icons, as well as the
usual cut/copy/paste tools.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-toolbar.png" NAME="Graphic4" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=299 HEIGHT=28 BORDER=0></P>
<P>The tools toolbar has several of the same tools found in the main
window, but it adds icons for step recording and the quantizer.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-tools-toolbar.png" NAME="Graphic5" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=179 HEIGHT=28 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>The transport toolbar is the same as the one found in
the matrix.</P>
<P ALIGN=RIGHT><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-transport-toolbar.png" NAME="Graphic6" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=294 HEIGHT=33 BORDER=0></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">The
layout toolbar allows you to change the way notation is displayed in
various ways. You can switch between linear layout mode, continuous
page mode, and multiple page mode. The linear mode scrolls
continuously off to the right, and it is the only mode that has
rulers. The continuous page mode displays notation formatted as
though it were a printed page, but it scrolls continuously toward the
bottom. Multiple page mode breaks the notation into discrete pages,
and provides a pager to allow you to get access to the portion of the
wish to view or edit.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">You can
use the <B>Font:</B> combo box to choose among the standard Feta
(courtesy of the Lilypond project), a bitmap version of Feta called
&quot;Feta Pixmaps,&quot; and the bitmap font used by a previous
incarnation of Rosegarden, called &quot;RG21.&quot;  The <B>Size:</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">
box functions somewhat like the zoom slider in the other views,
allowing you to magnify or reduce your view (but not your printouts
or exports.)  The </SPAN><B>Spacing:</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">
box allows you tweak how much space Rosegarden uses when laying out
the notation horizontally.</SPAN></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
<I>TIP:  It is also possible to use fonts from packages like Finale
if you prefer.   See the &quot;Note Fonts&quot;
(help:/rosegarden/nv-note-fonts.html) and &quot;Customizing
Rosegarden&quot; (help:/rosegarden/developers.html) topics in the
Rosegarden Handbook for more details.</I></P>

<H2 CLASS="western">Opening Multiple Staffs</H2>
<P>Many posters on the rosegarden-user mailing list use Rosegarden to
work with piano notation, so I have chosen a simple flute with piano
accompaniment arrangement as the place in which to demonstrate
various entry and editing features.</P>
<P>I mentioned in the introduction to this chapter that Rosegarden
has made few compromises in order to be able to do a bang up job as
both a notation editor and a MIDI sequencer.  This example also
serves to highlight one of those compromises.  It is not possible to
display an entire piano part on one grand staff.  Neither is it
possible to do a good, clear job of writing multiple parts or voices
on the same staff.  Due to both of these limitations, you will
probably want to write the bass and treble parts in different
segments, and thus on separate staffs.  These segments can be in the
same track, but if they are exactly the same length, and they overlap
each other exactly, it will be impossible to select whichever segment
lies on the bottom.  For this reason, I recommend putting the right
and left hand parts on different tracks as well.</P>
<P>For this example, I have created three segments on three tracks. 
I've labeled the top one &quot;flute&quot; and have assigned it to a
device and instrument that will play a flute program on channel 1. 
The remaining two tracks are labeled by right or left hand, and they
are both assigned to the same piano instrument, which will play using
a piano program on channel 2.  I have selected all three of these
segments in order to open them in a combined notation view:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-segments.png" NAME="Graphic20" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=456 HEIGHT=119 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Notation Basics</H3>
<P>Unless you have changed the default notation display mode, the
notation view should open in its default linear layout mode, like
this:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-empty-segments-editing.png" NAME="Graphic18" WIDTH=532 HEIGHT=351 BORDER=0></P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Notation Rulers</H4>
<P>Just like the matrix view, there are two distinct sets of rulers
here.  At the top of the window you will find a tempo ruler, a
special raw note ruler, which I will describe later on, and an an
insertion ruler for manipulating the insertion cursor.  The insertion
cursor determines the point at which notation elements are inserted.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-rules.png" NAME="Graphic11" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=228 HEIGHT=224 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>In a multiple staff situation such as this, you will
notice that the insertion cursor only spans a single staff.  This
lets you know which staff is the active target for various
operations.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><I>NOTE:  The tempo ruler here in the notation view is
provide for reference only.  Tempo must be edited from the main
window.</I></P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Clefs</H4>
<P>There are at least two ways to enter a clef.  Regardless of which
you use, you first need to position the insertion cursor at the
correct insertion point, if it isn't there already.  Select the
target staff by double clicking on it.     Then you can use <B>Segment
-&gt; Add Clef Change</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"> from the
menu.  A clef chooser dialog will appear, allowing you to choose from
a variety of different clefs in different <I>8va</I> configurations
by clicking on the various arrows.  The up/down arrows change between
<I>8</I> and <I>16va</I> up or down, respectively, and the left/right
arrows cycle through the various available clefs.  The dialog will
remember the clef you used last time, making it more convenient to
insert multiple clefs.  (There is no option to insert a clef in more
than one place at once, so you will have to add a clef to each staff
manually.)</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">The <B>Existing notes following clef
change</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"> portion of this dialog
is particularly useful in a situation where you began entering
notation before choosing a clef.  Rosegarden thinks in treble, and
treble is the default if no clef is present.  If </SPAN><B>[x]
Transpose into appropriate octave</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">
is selected, Rosegarden will attempt to find the best transposition
of any existing notation relative to the new clef.  (If this has
undesired consequences, as it sometimes does, then you can transpose
again by hand, as I will discuss in due course.)</SPAN></P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="font-weight: medium"><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-clef-dialog.png" NAME="Graphic22" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=228 HEIGHT=255 BORDER=0></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">If you prefer, you can use the Clefs
toolbar.  (The Clefs toolbar is not toggled on by default.)</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-clefs-toolbar.png" NAME="Graphic9" WIDTH=116 HEIGHT=54 BORDER=0></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">To use the toolbar, first switch to
the  
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-arrow-cursor.png" NAME="Graphic21" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=27 HEIGHT=27 BORDER=0>
cursor, then select one of the clefs from the Clefs toolbar.  Click
in one of the staffs, and the selected clef should be inserted.  If
you find a dead zone near the time signature, you may need to click
around a bit until you find the magic spot.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Key Signatures</H4>
<P>Key signatures are added in a similar fashion to clefs.  Position
the insertion cursor as appropriate, select the target staff, and
then use <B>Segment -&gt; Add Key Change</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">
from the menu.  You will be presented with a dialog that allows you
to choose from all major and minor keys up through seven accidentals.</SPAN></P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="font-weight: medium"><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-key-signature-dialog.png" NAME="Graphic23" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=203 HEIGHT=304 BORDER=0></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">In addition to changing the key
signature itself, you can use the <B>Scope</B> controls to change
whether Rosegarden will insert the new key signature only in the
target staff, or in all staffs (segments) at this point in time.  You
may also decide whether Rosegarden should favor the existing pitches,
possibly creating new accidentals in the new key, or favor the
current accidentals, which might change the pitches in the new key. 
Rosegarden can also attempt to transpose the notation into the new
key.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><BR><BR>
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Entering Notes and Rests</H4>
<P>Rosegarden provides a variety of ways to enter notes, providing
tools for both mouse- and keyboard-oriented composers.  Perhaps the
quickest way to get started is to use the several associated toolbars
and point and click a few notes into existence.  (I will cover the
other methods a bit later on.)</P>
<H5 CLASS="western">Notes</H5>
<P>Switch to the 
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-arrow-cursor.png" NAME="Graphic24" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=27 HEIGHT=27 BORDER=0>
tool, which puts the editor into insert mode.  To enter a note,
choose either a standard or a dotted duration from the Notes toolbar.
 Then click in one of the staffs to insert a note at that location.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-notes-toolbar.png" NAME="Graphic16" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=464 HEIGHT=54 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-enter-first-note.png" NAME="Graphic25" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=266 HEIGHT=106 BORDER=0></P>
<H5 CLASS="western">Rests</H5>
<P>Rests are treated as negative space, and Rosegarden attempts to
pad out the measure with rests automatically.  However, it is often
useful, even necessary, to enter them manually.  For example, switch
to the 8<SUP>th</SUP> note duration and then try to enter an 8<SUP>th</SUP>
note on the far side of that quarter rest, leaving an 8<SUP>th</SUP>
rest in between.  It's impossible.  You'll wind up with a result like
this every time:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-enter-first-note1.png" NAME="Graphic26" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=276 HEIGHT=98 BORDER=0></P>
<P>The trick to this is to manually insert a rest, which causes
Rosegarden to subdivide the beat; giving you a place to insert your
new note.  To change this note into a rest, select an appropriate
duration from the Rests toolbar, then click on the note head to
replace it with a rest.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-rests-toolbar.png" NAME="Graphic17" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=402 HEIGHT=54 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-enter-first-note2.png" NAME="Graphic27" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=277 HEIGHT=92 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Now you can change to an 8<SUP>th</SUP> note on the
Notes toolbar and enter the remaining note in the correct location.</P>
<P ALIGN=RIGHT><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-enter-first-note3.png" NAME="Graphic28" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=291 HEIGHT=104 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Notice as you do this that the insertion cursor
advances to the next beat division.  Remember that you can reposition
it using the insertion ruler.  What you cannot do, however, is move
it to an arbitrary point in time.  It always snaps along beat
divisions, depending on how the measure is divided, and it can
sometimes be a bit fiddling getting a not just where you want it. 
Particularly if you're adding a new note to existing notation, as
when turning a single note into a chord, for example.</P>
<H5 CLASS="western">Chords</H5>
<P>When using the toolbars and other graphical tools to insert notes,
creating chords is as simple as clicking in a new note above or below
an existing one.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-enter-first-note4.png" NAME="Graphic14" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=296 HEIGHT=119 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>You can also select a series of notes spaced out over
time,</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 3.94in">  
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-chords.png" NAME="Graphic53" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=91 HEIGHT=76 BORDER=0>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT> then use the 
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/icon-make-chord.png" NAME="Graphic52" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=19 BORDER=0>
icon...                                                              
           
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>to pull them into a chord.    
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-chords1.png" NAME="Graphic54" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=83 HEIGHT=86 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><BR><BR>
</P>
<H5 CLASS="western">Nudging an Incorrect Pitch</H5>
<P>In the preceding example, I entered what was trying to be an F
major chord in the key of E<SUB>b</SUB>.  The easiest way to fix the
errant A<SUB>b</SUB> from here is to nudge it with the arrow keys on
the keyboard.  First select the note in question, then raise it a
halfstep by hitting the up arrow key once.  (I could also have
avoided writing the note incorrectly in the first place, as I will
explain later on.)</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-enter-first-note5.png" NAME="Graphic29" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=293 HEIGHT=104 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>You can transpose individual notes or entire selections
in this fashion, one semitone at a time.  The accidentals along the
way will be based on the key signature.  Flats in a flat key, sharps
in a sharp key.  If you want to write a sharp in a flat key, you'll
have to change it manually, as I will explain further on.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<H5 CLASS="western">Erasing Notes</H5>
<P>In order to pave the way for the next example, this is a good time
to introduce the 
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-erase-cursor.png" NAME="Graphic30" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=26 BORDER=0>
cursor.  Select it and then click on individual notes to erase them. 
To follow along at home, remove the F major chord and step back to a
time when there was just an A<SUB>b</SUB> here.</P>
<H5 CLASS="western">Avoiding Multiple Voices</H5>
<P>Rosegarden cannot handle situations involving multiple musical
lines written on the same staff very well at all.  From a MIDI
performance perspective, there is no reason why you cannot have an
entire violin concerto in a single segment, and you can manipulate
this data to your heart's content with the other editors, but the
notation editor will never produce  good results attempting to
interpret data like this into legible notation.  It attempts to
display the notation as a single line, and this can lead to a great
deal of awkwardness.  For example,  select a dotted 8<SUP>th</SUP>
note duration from the Notes toolbar and then add a note above the
first quarter note.  Rosegarden splits and ties the quarter note and
displays the whole mess as a chord.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-counterpoint.png" NAME="Graphic31" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=318 HEIGHT=120 BORDER=0></P>
<P>You can undo this if you do so immediately, but if you wish to go
back later on and erase the top note, the bottom note will remain a
split-and-tied pair permanently, because it has become two separate
events.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-counterpoint1.png" NAME="Graphic32" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=295 HEIGHT=93 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>If you erase both of these notes, you wind up with some
unwieldy looking rests.</P>
<P ALIGN=RIGHT><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-counterpoint2.png" NAME="Graphic33" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=308 HEIGHT=80 BORDER=0></P>
<P>All of these problems can be solved, and no permanent harm has
been done, but the fact remains that Rosegarden simply is not able to
cope with this kind of situation elegantly.</P>
<P><I>NOTE:  Part writing is one of the most often-requested
features, and is almost certain to be implemented in some fashion at
some point in the future.</I></P>
<H5 CLASS="western">Making Selections</H5>
<P>Just like in the other views, you can select groups of notes to
isolate them from the rest of a staff.  Each note will sound as you
select it.</P>
<P>Switch back to the 
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-arrow-cursor.png" NAME="Graphic34" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=27 HEIGHT=27 BORDER=0>
tool.  You can select individual notes by shift clicking them, or you
can make a sweep selection by clicking and dragging the blue
selection box until it includes the notes you want.</P>
<P>You can select an entire measure at once by double clicking it, or
you can select an entire staff by triple clicking.</P>
<H5 CLASS="western">Collapsing Rests</H5>
<P>If you find yourself in an ugly situation such as the preceding
example, you can instruct Rosegarden to recalculate and collapse the
rests.  First you will need to make a selection, then use <B>Adjust
-&gt; Rests...</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"> to tidy things
up.</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">If you choose<B> Normalize Rests</B>,
Rosegarden will attempt to reduce the rests along beat divisions.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="font-weight: medium"><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-normalize-rests.png" NAME="Graphic35" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=285 HEIGHT=78 BORDER=0></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">If you choose <B>Collapse Rests</B>,

irrespective of beat divisions.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="font-weight: medium"><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-collapse-rests.png" NAME="Graphic36" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=271 HEIGHT=85 BORDER=0></P>
<H5 CLASS="western">Accidentals</H5>
<P>I already mentioned that you can nudge an errant note into place
with the arrow keys, but what if you need to enter an accidental
intentionally?  The Accidentals toolbar allows you to control the
accidental state of entered notes.  The default &quot;No Accidental&quot;
mode will enter notation that follows the key signature.  You can
override this with any of the other choices.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-accidentals-toolbar.png" NAME="Graphic8" WIDTH=172 HEIGHT=54 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To enter this phrase from J.

<H4 CLASS="western">Ties, Slurs, and Other Groups</H4>

accomplished using the Group toolbar.  As these actions are designed
to affect groups of notes, most of them will be disabled until you
have made a selection.</P>

<H5 CLASS="western">Micro-Positioning of Notation Elements</H5>
<P>I had planned to introduce this feature later on, but the example
I just showed is screaming to be twiddled.  That slur is very badly
positioned, and it looks terrible.  Rosegarden's layout algorithm
doesn't always get things quite right.  Fortunately, you can
re-position virtually anything to take matters into your own hands
and give things a nudge when required.  Simply select the element or
elements you wish to reposition, hold down the shift key, then drag
them wherever you want.  Their new positions will be remembered,
stored with the composition, and printed, although this
micro-positioning is not exportable to external notation formats like
Lilypond.</P>
<P>You can take this to ridiculous extremes if you wish.  You can
even create notes that sound as one pitch, yet which are displayed on
a different line, or even a different staff.  I'll show you one
example of a way to work around one of Rosegarden's limitations by
taking advantage of the no-holds-barred nature of this feature later
on, but it is not usually terribly useful to abuse your power to this
degree:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-select-for-slur2.png" NAME="Graphic41" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=456 HEIGHT=136 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>However, when used in a reasonable fashion, this gives
Rosegarden the ability to produce quite satisfying results, even when
the layout algorithm might have done a better job.  (Although, no,
you cannot, for example, alter the shape of this slur.  You can only
change where it is positioned on the page.)</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-select-for-slur3.png" NAME="Graphic42" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=201 HEIGHT=94 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>If you find you've made a complete mess of things, you
can use <B>Adjust -&gt; Fine Positioning -&gt; Restore Computed
Positions</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"> to revert the
position of the selected element, or elements to normal.</SPAN></P>
<H5 CLASS="western">Ties</H5>
<P>Ties are accomplished using the  icon.</P>
<P>They work just like slurs, except that they must occur between two
notes of the same pitch.  If you attempt to tie two notes at
different pitches, this will fail silently.  No tie will appear,
although the first note will actually have a &quot;tied forward&quot;
property, and if you subsequently drag it in line with another note,
the invisible tie will spring to life.  This can be a source of
confusion if you forget what you did.</P>
<P>Select two notes...

<P ALIGN=CENTER>Use the

 icon to tie them....

<H5 CLASS="western">Stem Direction</H5>
<P>If you need to change the computed stem direction, use
Ctrl+PageUp/PageDown or <B>Adjust -&gt; Stem Direction -&gt; Stems
Up/Stems Down</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">.</SPAN></P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="font-weight: medium"><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-stems-up.png" NAME="Graphic46" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=149 HEIGHT=74 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">If you wish to restore the
computed direction, use <B>Adjust -&gt; Stem Direction -&gt; Restore
Computed Stems.</B></P>
<H5 CLASS="western">Beaming</H5>
<P>You can beam or un-beam notes as required.  F<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">or
example, to break up the beams that were automatically applied,
select two notes, and then use either the beam or</SPAN></P>

<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-beam.png" NAME="Graphic48" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=188 HEIGHT=72 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">As you can see from this
rather poorly-chosen example...  
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-beam1.png" NAME="Graphic49" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=192 HEIGHT=103 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">It is sometimes be a bit
fiddly to achieve the desired results.  I had to go back and un-beam
the entire group of 16<SUP>th</SUP> notes and then re-beam them into
two pairs in order to get where I wanted to be.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="font-weight: medium"><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/notation-beam2.png" NAME="Graphic50" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=186 HEIGHT=81 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium"><I>NOTE:  Changing the
beaming of slurred notes causes the slur to be re-computed.  If you
have micro-positioned the slur, your manual adjustment will be
destroyed, and you will have to reposition the new slur.  It would
probably be best to get the beaming straight before adding slurs.</I></P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Marks</H4>
<P>The Marks toolbar contains too many icons for me to possibly
describe each in detail.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>Rosegarden does not try to be your mother, and it will
let you add an absolutely insane number of marks in ridiculous
combinations to a note.</P>

<H4 CLASS="western">Text Events</H4>
<H5 CLASS="western">I ii iii IV</H5>
<P>Someone asked me how he could use Rosegarden to notate Roman
numerals to indicate intervals or chord progressions.  While there is
no facility specifically for this purpose, chord names work perfectly
well.  Here I have marked of the I IV V of a typical rock chord
progression.</P>
