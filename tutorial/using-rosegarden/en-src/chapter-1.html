Introduction</H1>
<H2 STYLE="border: none; padding: 0in"><A NAME="1_1"></A>What is
Rosegarden?</H2>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
Rosegarden-4, hereafter referred to as simply Rosegarden, is a
versatile application that seeks to be a useful tool for those
wanting to create music. It combines aspects of a MIDI sequencer, an
audio sequencer, and a notation editor into one convenient, easy to
use package that provides users with a consistent and intuitive
interface.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
Rosegarden is a native KDE application that can run on any system
that has the KDE and QT libraries installed, and currently requires a
minimum of KDE/QT 3.1 in order to run. Many of its features may only
work on Linux systems, but it is designed to compile and run on any
Unix-like platform capable of running KDE. (See the<A HREF="http://rosegardenmusic.com/faq.html">
FAQ</A> for details on building for systems that can't run ALSA.)</P>
<H2 STYLE="border: none; padding: 0in">About This Guide</H2>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
My goal in writing this guide is to help you explore Rosegarden, and
to discover ways to use its features to solve real problems that you
might encounter when creating your own music. Rosegarden is easy to
use, once you come to understand its framework, but it's not quite
like anything you are likely to have used in the past. As such, I
wish to take you on a guided tour through Rosegarden, to demonstrate
many of its capabilities, and to offer you a foundation from which
your own creative projects can spring.</P>
<H2 STYLE="border: none; padding: 0in"><A NAME="1_3"></A>Version and
System Requirements</H2>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
This document describes Rosegarden4, the latest in this venerable
line of applications; not to be confused with the older Rosegarden
that was last updated in 1997.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
You should be running...</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
[This will probably require version 1.0 or later of everything
involved, but at this pre-release writing everything except ALSA is
still pre-release.  These requirements need to be edited and updated
prior to final publication of this document.]</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
[I should talk about minimum acceptable hardware/RAM specs, and
preferred minimum audio hardware and such like, but I haven't yet
given any real thought to this, and don't have anything to put down
just yet.]</P>
<H2 STYLE="border: none; padding: 0in"><A NAME="1_4"></A>The Author's
Studio</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">Obviously,
what I can actually demonstrate is hardware dependent. I'd like you
to bear in mind what is sitting in front of me as I write this, and
thus I will share the details of my &quot;studio.&quot;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">I'm
running a 2.0 GHz P4 with 512 MB of RAM; Debian Sarge, and KDE 3.2.3.
I've compiled Debian's kerenel 2.4.26 source with Debian's pre-empt
and low latency patches.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">My MIDI
landscape centers around an SB Live! with an old joystick MIDI port
box from Gravis. I have the MIDI out from a Fatar MIDI-72 controller
keyboard attached to the MIDI in on the box, and the MIDI out on the
box connects to the MIDI in on my Roland SC-33 Sound Canvas. I
usually load the <A HREF="ftp://anonymous@tp://ftp.personalcopy.net/pub/PC51f.sf2.gz">PC51f.sf2</A>
soundfont into the SB Live!, and rarely change it.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">In the
way of other gear, I have a reasonably good electret microphone from
Radio Shack, which I use to record my acoustic guitar, flute, and
other traditional instruments. I have an electric guitar and a
DigiTech RP-200 effects box for those times I want to play rock star.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">I route
all of this through my Sound Blaster's mixer. I can't currently have
everything feeding into the soundcard at the same time, and I must
swap cables around in order to feed either the Sound Canvas or the
RP-200 into the &quot;line in&quot; jack.</P>

owned by important, well-monied corporations and probably need to
have cute little symbols in circles or superscript or something
attached to their names. I have far better things to do than try to
figure out which cute little symbols are supposed to go on which
names, but if representatives from any of the corporations who own
those words would be so kind as to inform me which little symbols
need to be attached to them, I will attach such symbols forthwith.</P>
