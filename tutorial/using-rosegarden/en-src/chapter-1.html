Introduction</H1>
<H2 STYLE="border: none; padding: 0in"><A NAME="1_1"></A>What is
Rosegarden?</H2>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
Rosegarden-4, hereafter referred to as simply Rosegarden, is a
versatile application that seeks to be a useful tool for those
wanting to create music. It combines aspects of a MIDI sequencer, an
audio sequencer, and a notation editor into one convenient, easy to
use package that provides users with a consistent and intuitive
interface.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
<SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">Rosegarden is one of many audio and
MIDI applications and utilities for Linux, and it integrates well
with related applications.  This relationship centers around two
different Linux standards.  One the one hand, Rosegarden is closely
tied to the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) MIDI
infrastructure, and it works very well with other ALSA MIDI
applications such as Qsynth, ZynAddSubFX and Hydrogen.  On the other
hand Rosegarden is also tied to the Jack Audio Connection Kit (JACK),
and it works well with other JACK applications.  Rosegarden can stand
well on its own, but its true strength is in how well it combines
with other applications as part of a total home studio solution.</SPAN></P>
<H2 STYLE="border: none; padding: 0in">About This Guide</H2>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
This guide is part manual, part tutorial. I attempt to showcase
Rosegarden's most significant features, and give you suggestions for
how to use (or work around) these features in order to achieve your
musical goals.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
This guide is generally arranged to be read from cover to cover, and
to proceed through Rosegarden's feature set window by window in a
logical way. If you wish to home straight in on a specific topic, the
table of contents is thorough, and the web version is fully
hyperlinked.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
Each chapter is loosely divided into two parts. The first half
details the mechanical side of making use of various controls in
order to manipulate data in some way. The latter half focuses on
demonstrating how to use these controls to achieve common musical
goals.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
Menu options and references to some dialog pages or tabs are
formatted in bold, with arrows indicating the progression through the
layers of menus.  For example, if I say to use <B>File -&gt; Import
-&gt; Import MIDI File</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"> this
means to begin at the &quot;File&quot; menu, find &quot;Import&quot;
on this menu and hover on it until the submenu opens out, then click
on &quot;Import MIDI File.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Various personal tips and &quot;unofficial&quot; workarounds are

System Requirements</H2>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
This document describes Rosegarden4, the latest in this venerable
line of applications; not to be confused with the older Rosegarden
that was last updated in 1997.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
The new Rosegarden is a native KDE application that can run on any
system that has the KDE and QT libraries installed, and currently
requires a minimum of KDE/QT 3.1 in order to run.  As of version 1.0,
Rosegarden is closely tied to ALSA, and ALSA has not, to my
knowledge, been ported to platforms like OS-X and FreeBSD.  Until
such porting occurs, the majority of Rosegarden's features are
limited to the Linux platform exclusively.  It should compile and run
on other platforms, but most of its features will be disabled.</P>
<H3>Linux Version</H3>
<P>The more recent your distribution, the better.  Rosegarden and
many related, interdependent applications are all very new.     We at
Rosegarden suggest that you run the very latest release version of
the distribution of your choice, at a minimum.  We further suggest
that a distribution with special emphasis on Linux audio, such as
<A HREF="http://www.agnula.org/">AGNULA</A> or <A HREF="http://ccrma.stanford.edu/planetccrma/software/introduction.html">Planet
CCRMA</A> might well be worth your consideration if you find yourself
having trouble getting all of these things to cooperate.  Linux audio
is a bit of an arcane and complex area at the present, and these
special distributions seek to remove much of the sting.  My personal
recommendation would be to take a look at DeMuDi, AGNULA's
Debian-based live CD distribution.  As a matter of personal
preference, I try to stay as far away from Red Hat-based distros as
possible, and I strongly prefer the Debian package management system.
 <I>&Agrave; chaq'un son go&ucirc;t.</I></P>
<H3>Minimum Computer Specs</H3>
<P>If you wish to do MIDI only, and if you have a soundcard or
external synthesizer capable of doing the work of playing music
largely on its own, you can probably get by with as little as
PII-233.  The more RAM the better.</P>
<P>If you need to use a soft synth such as QSynth for MIDI
production, I have found that an 800 MHz machine with 128 MB of RAM
is the minimum spec box that I could get working acceptably.  This
machine was completely useless when using JACK, so I had to run
Rosegarden with its audio features disabled, and I had to play QSynth
through the ALSA output, rather than the more usual JACK output.  (I
will cover these topics in detail in &quot;You Don't Know JACK,&quot;
so don't despair if you have no idea what I'm talking about.)</P>
<P>To get the most out of Rosegarden with the least amount of kernel
hacking and other tweaking, I've found a 2.0 GHz P4 with 512 MB of
RAM delivers acceptable MIDI and audio performance using a standard,
unpatched 2.4 kernel, running both JACK and Rosegarden with normal
user <SPAN LANG="en-US">privileges, using a cheap Wal-Mart Sound
Blaster Live!.</SPAN></P>
<H3>Suggested Minimum Hardware</H3>
<P>My <B>recommended</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"> minimum
soundcard is an emu101k-based card such as the venerable Sound
Blaster Live! and its many descendants and clones.  This card can do
in hardware most of what QSynth can do with software, so you have a
decent internal synth for MIDI performance without the CPU penalties.
 You can still run QSynth if you want (CPU performance allowing) to
take advantage of its integrated LADSPA plugins for effects.  It has
a joystick port MIDI adapter (additional Y-cable or interface box
required) for interfacing with external MIDI devices, and it can just
barely be coaxed into functioning with JACK without resorting to
kernel hacking and arcane audio performance tweaking.  A $15 SB Live!
and a $50 Wal-Mart home theater system make for a rather decent
sounding home audio solution on the cheap.</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">For real performance, you will
probably want to look at professional level soundcards.  The mAudio
Audiophile 2426 comes highly recommended as a good entry level card. 
It has a MIDI interface, but only sports a limited number of inputs
and outputs.  Serious audio people will probably want to look beyond
the Audiophile and get into serious money and performance territory. 
Better solutions offer more inputs and outputs, and nice extras such
as breakout boxes, but many do not offer MIDI ports, so you're stuck
buying additional hardware if you want to use external MIDI hardware.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">In writing this document, I assume
that most of my readers are weekend jammers like me, trying to make
the best of  low quality hardware, and are too cheap or too broke to
buy something better.  I focus on the SB Live! as the lowest common
denominator, because dealing with that card has the greatest chance
of being useful to the largest number of people, and because it's a
decent, if inferior, all-in-one solution as the centerpiece of a home
studio.  If you are attempting to use something even more pathetic,
then I hope perhaps you can pop for $15 to upgrade to a slightly less
crappy soundcard.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">If someone wants to buy me some pro
gear, I'll be happy to change my perspective and focus on how to get
the most out of the big dollar toys.  :)</P>
