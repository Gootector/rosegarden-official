<H1>Managing Audio Projects (unwritten)</H1>
<P>This will pound on the importance of maintaining a separate audio
directory for each new project, and demonstrate the use of the audio
file manager.  Perhaps other things, depending on what still needs
mentioning after the chapter dealing with audio instruments is
finalized.  I've covered audio segments inline with MIDI segments
already, and audio instruments with MIDI instruments, but I still
need a home for audio file management issues.  This is it, I guess.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Mastering</H2>
<P>This chapter will eventually deal with the vagaries of putting
audio and MIDI streams together and mixing them down into a finished
.wav file.</P>
<P>I don't expect to get to this until last. In the meantime, I offer
the following quick and dirty information:</P>
<P>You can master in one of two ways. One is to set up a dedicated
mastering track and play everything while having Rosegarden record
itself. You can use Rosegarden's internal MIDI and audio mixers to
help make this job easier.</P>
<P>The more flexible way is to route Rosegarden's JACK outputs into
something else, like JAMin or Ardour. JAMin looks like a promising
tool here, but I haven't really explored it.</P>
