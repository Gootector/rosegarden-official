<H1>Appendix A: MIDI Primer</H1>
<P>MIDI stands for Musical Instrument Digital Interface.  It is a
simple serial protocol that electronic instruments and computers  can
use to talk to each other.  MIDI-capable instruments vary enormously
in their capabilities and complexity, ranging from simple analog
synthesizers to pipe organs to electronic guitars, and even to
electronic woodwinds and brass instruments.</P>
<P>MIDI-capable instruments aren't required to have much in common,
but there are a several categories of characteristics that most of
them share.</P>
<H2>Channels</H2>
<P>If you have a cable TV, you can receive more than one television
channel over the same wire.  MIDI channels behave in a similar
fashion.  Any one MIDI cable can be used to carry up to 16 channels
of information.  Most common modern equipment is capable of receiving
on all 16 of these channels simultaneously, and many types of
equipment can also transmit on more than one channel.</P>
<P>These channels work something like the tracks in Rosegarden, which
is why channel assignment is done at the track level.  If you set the
reverb level for channel 3, this setting will only affect notes that
are transmitted on channel 3.  Channels are similarly useful for
playing different instruments at the same time, over the same cable,
or for playing using different voices on a single instrument.</P>
<H2>Programs</H2>
<P>Most common MIDI instruments are polyphonic and multi-timbral. 
This means that they can play more than one note at the same time,
and they can play notes using different voices.  Many instruments try
to simulate a proverbial band-in-a-box by offering a range of sounds
ranging from piano through the orchestra into synthesized and ethnic
sounds.  These simulated instruments are called either &quot;programs&quot;
or &quot;patches.&quot;</P>
<P>In the most common MIDI standard, General MIDI (GM), instruments
must be able to play using any of 128 different programs.  Music
written to be performed on one GM instrument should sound similar on
any other.  The GM specification dictates that channel 10 will play
drum sounds, and it defines a standard arrangement of keys on the
keyboard to represent different drums.</P>
<H2>Banks</H2>
<P>Beyond the GM standard, many instruments have banks of additional
programs.  The MIDI specification allows for a monumental number of
different banks, but most instruments arrange banks in two common
ways.  The two most common standards for this expansion of GM are
called GS (Roland) and XG (Yamaha.)  The usual General MIDI programs
are in the first bank, and the extra programs are found in additional
banks.  Each bank has a unique identifying number using a combination
of two parameters.  They are Least Significant Byte (LSB) and Most
Significant Byte (MSB).  The standard GM bank on every GM-compliant
synth has an LSB/MSB address of 0 0.</P>
<H2>Controllers</H2>
<P>MIDI allows for 128 controllers.  These controllers typically work
at a channel level, and are used to control things such as pan (how
far to the left or right the sound will play), volume (the overall
maximum volume for the channel), pitch bend (used to simulate guitar
and harmonica bends, play quarter tones, as well as numerous other
uses), reverb (makes notes on the channel sound like they're in a
concert hall) and sustain (causes the note to keep playing unhampered
until the sound finally dies away, like the sustain pedal on a
piano).  There is enormous variability in this area, and you will
find some equipment that ignores them all, while other instruments
will use nearly all 128 of them.   You will need to know what kind of
controllers your equipment (or software synth) supports if you are to
configure Rosegarden to make use of them, though it does come out of
the box aware of a very limited subset of the most common
controllers.</P>
<H2>Hardware vs. Software; soundfonts</H2>
<P>So far I have dealt primarily with &quot;real&quot; MIDI
equipment.  Where do soundcards and soft synths fit in?</P>
<P>Some soundcards such as the Sound Blaster Live! and its relatives
have a hardware synth built into the card.  It's synth is actually
four synths in one, accessed through four different ports, and each
of them can receive 16 channels of information, and can play drums on
channel 10 (making it possible to use four different drum kits
simultaneously).  Many, probably even most other common soundcards
and integrated audio solutions do not have such hardware MIDI
playback capability.  Users who have these cards will need to run a
software synth such as QSynth that uses the computer's resources to
do what a card like the SB Live! can do in hardware.  (I explain the
vagaries of getting QSynth up and running and cooperating with JACK
in the chapter titled &quot;You Don't Know JACK.&quot;)</P>
<P> The on-board synth on the SB Live! and QSynth both use the same
kind of soundfonts, stored in .sf2 files, to provide programs.  Many
soundfonts are configured to resemble either GM or XG, and the
programs they contain are accessed the same way, as though QSynth
were a GM or XG synth.  Other soundfonts use other arrangements, and
there are few fast rules.  For example, I have a soundfont that only
plays a harpsichord, no matter what channel I use, and another one
that plays drums, but only works on channel 10.  Rosegarden can read
most of this information from soundfonts, so soundfont users will
have less to worry about when it comes time to set up their studio.</P>
<H2>The Odd Ducks</H2>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">A great deal of
the equipment out there falls into none of these categories.  Pipe
organs are especially bizarre creatures from what I hear.  Older
synths from the '80s tend to receive on fewer than 16 channels.  Some
synths are not multi-timbral, and some are monophonic.  Many pieces
of equipment just don't have any sort of program/patch system that
lends itself to referring to programs by name, so it's more useful to
use numbers instead.  There are also software synths that don't seem
to react to program changes at all, such as ZynAddSubFX and Hydrogen.</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">You
need to understand and be aware of the capabilities of whatever
you're using before you can configure your studio effectively.  The
best advice for is to read the supplied documentation and see what
its capabilities are.  Documentation for used MIDI equipment can
frequently be found online.  Of course, when all else fails, you're
left with trial and error.</SPAN></SPAN></P>
