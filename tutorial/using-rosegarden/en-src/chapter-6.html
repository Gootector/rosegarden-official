<H1><A NAME="6"></A>You Don't Know JACK</H1>
<P>In order to make use of Rosegarden's audio features, you will need
to run JACK.</P>
<P>JACK is short for the &ldquo;Jack Audio Connection Kit.&rdquo;
This marvel is at the heart of Linux audio, and it allows for a level
of interoperability between applications that's undreamt of in the
world of proprietary software. Jack is the cement that binds together
a host of varied applications, and lets them all work together
seamlessly.</P>
<H2>Starting and tweaking JACK</H2>
<P>The simplest way to control your JACK server is to use <B>qjackctl</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">.
 It takes a lot of the sting out of the process, and presents you
with a nice interface to show you how things are going.  It is, of
course, not a part of Rosegarden, and you will need to install it
separately.</SPAN></P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="font-weight: medium"><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/qjackctl-overview.png" NAME="Graphic1" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=393 HEIGHT=78 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">In the above example, you
see what it's <B>supposed</B> to look like.  Sometimes getting it to
play nice is no mean feat.  Notice in particular that I am showing 0
(0) where the xruns are reported.  xruns are JACK's way of telling
you that it isn't happy.  They cause audio dropouts and bad
performance.  Your goal in tweaking JACK is to achieve the lowest
latency possible while preventing xruns.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">To change how your JACK
server is configured, use the <B>Setup</B> button.  Here you can see
the settings that finally worked for me with my SB Live!.  It's
notable that I am running JACK strictly as a user, without real-time
capabilities enabled.  If you run JACK with real time turned on,
you'll have to run qjackctl, JACK, and Rosegarden as root, or else
you'll have to run a capabilities-enabled kernel so that you can run
them with root privleges as your user.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium"><I>I think.  Actually, I
don't know.  I have a hacked kernel, and no idea what to do with it. 
Nobody has ever answered any of my questions because I'm not a card
carrying member of the Linux Audio Cult.  The information out there
is enormously complicated, and this whole area is nothing but pure
voodoo.  It absolutely <B>sucks</B>, truthfully.</I></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium"><I>Until someone reads this
and finally shows me the light, we're both going to have to stumble
blindly through the dark with nothing but my half-formed and probably
pathetic understanding of how all of this is supposed to work.  But I
have indeed managed to accomplish a few things with this stuff, and I
can show you how I did it.</I></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">If you were running
Rosegarden before starting JACK, you'll need to close Rosegarden and
restart it in order to make its audio features available.  I will
cover the actual use of Rosegarden's features in Chapter 8.  For now
we are only concerned with how to get Rosegarden to cooperate with
other JACK-enabled applications.</P>
<H2>Using Rosegarden with a JACK-enabled Soft Synth</H2>
<P>Now that JACK is running and Rosegarden has hopefully set up some
default JACK connections for you, you can take advantage of
Rosegarden's ability to record and play audio.</P>
