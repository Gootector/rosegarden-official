<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">So far, we have largely ignored
Rosegarden's notation editing capabilities. While Rosegarden's
initial release lacks some key features that are necessary for
full-fledged score editing, it is nevertheless a powerful and
friendly notation editor.</P>

<FONT FACE="Arial">This chapter was completely out of date, so I
purged it.   It is completely rewritten in my own mind, but sitting
down to get it onto paper (onto magnetic particles anyway) just
hasn't been working out lately.  This will come as soon as I knock
out chapter 4 and finish tweaking chapter 3 for the twelve millionth
time.</FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Arial">I'm sorry this is taking so long, but it will be
worth the wait.  Thank you for your patience.</FONT></P>
