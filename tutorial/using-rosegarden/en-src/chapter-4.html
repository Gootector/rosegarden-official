<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">If you
have selected a MIDI segment, you will see something similar to this.
The exact controls available will depend on how you have your Studio
configured, and which MIDI output device is assigned to this
particular track. They allow you to control the instrument
assignment, and to adjust any controllers you have configured for
this device.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">If you
have selected an audio segment, then these controls are available.
They allow you to control the routing of the audio, and to add layers
of plugins. There are redundant Mute, Solo and Record toggles, as
well as volume sliders for left and right</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Now that you've configured your
Studio, you're probably eager to create some segments that contain
something interesting. In this chapter, I discuss different ways of
recording live performances with Rosegarden. My focus for the moment
still lies with manipulating data on the main window.</P>
<H2>Three Ways to Record</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">There are three different ways to
record with Rosegarden. If you come from a MIDI background, the most
obvious thing to do is plug in your MIDI keyboard and hit the record
button to record a MIDI segment in the currently-selected track. If
audio is your aim, you'll want to plug something into an input port
on your soundcard, set your mixer recording source and get to work.
On the other hand, if you have all the keyboard skill of a paraplegic
chipmunk, like I do, you might be more interested in the step
recording feature described in chapter 7.</P>
<H3>Connecting a Track</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Before you record, you might need to
assign and output device to the selected track. If you're recording
MIDI, then any MIDI device will do. Rosegarden cannot yet handle
multiple, concurrent MIDI inputs, so the input you wish to use for
recording should already have been connected while you were setting
up your Studio. (See <A HREF="http://chapter-3.html/">Chapter 3</A>
for more details.) If you're recording audio, you'll need to tell
Rosegarden that the currently selected track should contain audio
segments. Do this by directing its connection to one of the Jack
channels.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
You should be presented with a series of nested menus that allow you
to choose the MIDI (or Jack) device and channel for the track.</P>

<H3 STYLE="border: none; padding: 0in">What Do Those Black Boxes
Mean?</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">While
it's not immediately relevant to our discussion of recording, this is
a convenient place to talk about the odd little boxes you might have
noticed in the menus above.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">The
column of small boxes to the left of the channel provide a concise
way of showing information about the status of these connections. In
the examples above, you might have noticed that they were in several
different states. That's because I have connections configured in my
Studio for devices that aren't currently available, because the
associated softsynths aren't running, and because some of my external
MIDI, and some of my Jack channels weren't assigned to anything. (See
<A HREF="http://chapter-7.html/">Chapter 7</A> for more information
about running softsynths in conjunction with Rosegarden.)</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
These boxes convey the following information:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in"><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/using-rosegarden_html_72a37f4e.png" NAME="Graphic38" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=14 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0>
This instrument or device isn't very useful to you right now. It is
is <B>not in use</B> by a track, and it is <B>not connected</B> to
any active output path. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in"><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/using-rosegarden_html_3dc467bd.png" NAME="Graphic79" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=12 BORDER=0>
This instrument or device could provide a valid output path, and all
you need to do from here is attach it to a track and begin making use
of it. It <B>is connected</B> to an active output path, but it is <B>not
being used</B> by any track. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in"><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/using-rosegarden_html_1e7e4e7a.png" NAME="Graphic81" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=14 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0>
A track or tracks are connected to this device, but this is not
currently a valid output path, and the events on any tracks that are
connected don't have anywhere to go. This instrument or device is <B>in
use</B> by a track, but is <B>not connected</B> to an active output
path.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in"><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/using-rosegarden_html_e634bf.png" NAME="Graphic80" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=14 HEIGHT=16 BORDER=0>
This instrument or device provides a valid output path, and that path
is in use by at least one track. It <B>has a valid connection</B> to
an output path, and that connection is <B>in use</B> by a track.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
In addition, the instrument in use by the current track will have an
extra black outline around either a black filled or black outlined
box, depending on whether or not the path is connected to a valid
output:</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/using-rosegarden_html_500c240c.png" NAME="Graphic82" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=18 HEIGHT=18 BORDER=0>
The active track is connected to an output that is <B>also connected</B>.
If you play this track, you can expect the device you've hooked up to
make some noise.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/using-rosegarden_html_5204c333.png" NAME="Graphic83" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=18 HEIGHT=18 BORDER=0>
The active track is connected to an output that is <B>not connected</B>.
This track, on the other hand, won't make any noise until you assign
a different device to it or turn on the device that isn't currently
working.</P>
<H2>Recording MIDI</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Now that your track is assigned...</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Out of time. You hit the record
button. You get one measure of count-in, then a red segment starts to
appear. If you set it up right, you got stuff in there. If not, you
got a lot of empty nothing.</P>
