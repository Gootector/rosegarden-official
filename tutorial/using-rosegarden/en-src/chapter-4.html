<H1>Managing &quot;Instrument Parameters&quot;</H1>
<P>Now that you understand have configured your default studio to
suit your own needs, you might be wondering just how to make use of
all those programs and controllers you set up. As I have mentioned in
various other places, program changes and controllers in MIDI work on
a channel level.  In Rosegarden, these channel-level assignments are
encapsulated within &quot;instruments&quot; contained within each
&quot;device&quot; that can be assigned to any number of different
tracks.</P>
<H2>&quot;Instruments&quot;</H2>
<P>Rosegarden has yet another layer of abstraction between you and
your MIDI equipment, called the &quot;instrument.&quot;  Every
&quot;device&quot; has 16 &quot;instruments&quot; numbered #1 through
#16.  When working with MIDI playback devices, each of these
&quot;instruments&quot; encapsulates a MIDI output channel (the same
channel as the number of the &quot;instrument&quot; by default,
although this relationship is not fixed), a bank/program/variation
assignment, and any initial controllers you wish to affect the
associated channel.  These &quot;instruments&quot; allow you to
assemble up to 16 collections of programs/controllers per device and
assign these combinations to any number of tracks.</P>
<P>When working with audio and synth plugins, these &quot;instruments&quot;
serve the same purpose as MIDI channels, allowing you to configure up
to 16 different combinations of LADSPA plugins, volume and pan
settings, and so forth, and then apply these combinations to any
number of different tracks.</P>
<H2>Routing a Track to a &quot;Device&quot; and &quot;Instrument&quot;</H2>
<P>The first step in the assignment process is to route a track to a
particular &quot;device.&quot;  The &quot;device&quot; you use will
determine whether you can play audio or MIDI data on this track.  In
order to make this device assignment, begin by clicking the mouse
cursor in this area, and holding a moment until a context menu
appears.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/click-and-hold.png" NAME="Graphic3" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=231 HEIGHT=51 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
You should be presented with a series of two menus that allow you to
choose  first the &quot;device&quot; and then the &quot;instrument&quot;
for this track.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
In this case, I chose to route it to my &quot;Roland SC-33&quot;
device, which is ultimately connected through my Rosegarden studio to
play  through  ALSA port 64:0, and thus the Roland Sound Canvas I
have plugged into the box physically attached to my computer.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
Then I assigned it to that device's &quot;instrument&quot; #6.  Prior
to taking this snapshot, I had already configured this &quot;instrument&quot;
to play using the &quot;Piano 1&quot; program with the &quot;Instrument
 Parameters&quot; box (more on that in a bit), and so that name
appeared in parenthesis in the second menu.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
Notice also that &quot;instrument&quot;  #10 has (D) in parenthesis,
indicating that this &quot;instrument&quot; is normally used for
playing drums.  (Whether it actually plays drums depends on the
capabilities of the MIDI equipment or software synth represented by
this &quot;device,&quot; and probably depends on this &quot;instrument&quot;
continuing to remain at the default channel assignment of 10.)  In
this example, I arranged beforehand for this &quot;instrument&quot;
to play using the &quot;Power&quot; drum kit.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
The remaining &quot;instruments&quot; are not assigned to anything in
particular yet, and on most General MIDI -compliant equipment (or
software synths) these &quot;instruments&quot; will probably play
using a factory default piano program, with volume and other
controllers set to neutral default values.</P>

<H2>MIDI Instrument Parameters</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">Now that
the track has been throuth a MIDI output &quot;device&quot; and
&quot;instrument,&quot; and is therefore a MIDI track, the <B>Instrument
Parameters</B> box will display controls similar to these.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/instrument-parameters-midi-ins.png" NAME="Graphic2" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=260 HEIGHT=235 BORDER=0></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">They
allow you to reassign the channel for this &quot;instrument,&quot;
and to dial in a program. In this case, you can see Roland's
variation system in action. The program is set to &quot;20. Churg
Org. 1&quot; and the variation to &quot;17. Church Org. 3&quot; so
this &quot;instrument,&quot; and any tracks routed through it, will
play using a pipe organ sound that isn't part of the basic set of
General MIDI programs.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">If you
want to select a GS-style drum kit, your <B>Instrument Parameters</B>
box should look something like this:</P>

<H2>Synth Plugin Tracks</H2>
<P>[Waiting for this bleeding edge new feature to settle into
something stable before I mention it in any detail...  See
rosegarden-devel for more detalis.  Basically, these use plugins to
play MIDI using JACK for audio output.  They're hybrids, allowing you
to create sound with a synth plugin and then layer LADSPA plugins on
top to alter the sound.  They take MIDI segments, but their
instrument parameters are more like those of audio tracks, and they
can't be assigned to use programs in the same fashion as conventional
MIDI tracks; rather each synth plugin has its own mechanism to allow
it to be dialed to use whatever it's capable of doing.  More or less.
 More to follow.]</P>
<H2>JACK Tracks</H2>
<P>If you want to use a track for audio, you'll need to make it a
JACK track by routing it to the  &quot;JACK Audio&quot; device. (If
you do not have a &quot;JACK Audio&quot; device available, please
ensure that your JACK server is running. If you have problems with
this, see &quot;Starting and Routing Audio Through JACK&quot; later
on in this guide.)</P>

<H2>JACK Instrument Parameters</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">JACK
&quot;instruments&quot; have different controls available in the
<B>Instrument Parameters</B> box.. They allow you to control the
routing of the audio [In: Out: I have no clue what these are actually
good for.  This is what I mean by &quot;routing of the audio.&quot;],
and to add layers of plugins. There are redundant Mute, Solo and
Record toggles, as well as volume sliders for left and right</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">stereo
channels, and a mono/stereo toggle. (<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/audio-mono.png" NAME="Graphic8" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=24 HEIGHT=24 BORDER=0>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">If you
wish to assign LADSPA plugins to the track, you may use one of the
&quot;&lt;no plugin&gt;&quot; buttons to summon a dialog similar to
this one.  You can narrow in on what you want using the <B>Category:</B>
selector, and then dial in a particular plugin with the <B>Plugin:</B>
selector.  As you dial through these, the knobs in the bottom half of
this dialog box will change to reflect the controls that are
available for this particular plugin; ranging from one knob to a
screen full of them.  You can layer up to five plugins for each
&quot;instrument&quot; in the &quot;JACK Audio&quot; device, hardware
allowing.  Some plugins are particularly expensive in their use of
your system's resources, so using too many may cause performance
problems.</P>

<H2>What Do Those Black Boxes Mean?</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">The
column of small boxes to the left of the channel provide a concise
way of showing information about the status of these connections. In
the examples above, you might have noticed that they were in several
different states.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
These boxes convey the following information:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in"><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/using-rosegarden_html_72a37f4e.png" NAME="Graphic38" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=14 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0>
This &quot;instrument&quot; or &quot;device&quot; isn't very useful
to you right now. It is is <B>not in use</B> by a track, and it is
<B>not connected</B> to any active output path. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in"><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/using-rosegarden_html_3dc467bd.png" NAME="Graphic79" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=12 BORDER=0>
This &quot;instrument&quot; or &quot;device&quot; could provide a
valid output path, and all you need to do from here is attach it to a
track and begin making use of it. It <B>is connected</B> to an active
output path, but it is <B>not being used</B> by any track. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in"><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/using-rosegarden_html_1e7e4e7a.png" NAME="Graphic81" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=14 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0>
A track or tracks are connected to this &quot;device,&quot; but this
is not currently a valid output path, and the events on any tracks
that are routed through this &quot;device&quot; don't have anywhere
to go. This &quot;instrument&quot; or &quot;device&quot; is <B>in use</B>
by a track, but is <B>not connected</B> to an active output path.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in"><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/using-rosegarden_html_e634bf.png" NAME="Graphic80" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=14 HEIGHT=16 BORDER=0>
This &quot;instrument&quot; or &quot;device&quot; provides a valid
output path, and that path is in use by at least one track. It <B>has
a valid connection</B> to an output path, and that connection is <B>in
use</B> by a track.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
In addition, the instrument in use by the current track will have an
extra black outline around either a black filled or black outlined
box, depending on whether or not the path is connected to a valid
output:</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/using-rosegarden_html_500c240c.png" NAME="Graphic82" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=18 HEIGHT=18 BORDER=0>
The active track is connected to an output that is <B>also connected</B>.
If you play this track, you can expect the &quot;device&quot; you've
hooked up to make some noise.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/using-rosegarden_html_5204c333.png" NAME="Graphic83" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=18 HEIGHT=18 BORDER=0>
The active track is connected to an output that is <B>not connected</B>.
This track, on the other hand, won't make any noise until you assign
a different &quot;device&quot; to it or enable the &quot;device&quot;
that isn't currently working.</P>
<H1>Recording Basics</H1>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">There are three different ways to
record with Rosegarden. If you come from a MIDI background, the most
obvious thing to do is plug in your MIDI keyboard and hit the record
button to record a MIDI segment in the currently-selected track. If
audio is your aim, you'll want to set your mixer recording source and
get to work. On the other hand, if you have all the keyboard skill of
a paraplegic chipmunk, like I do, you might be more interested in
step recording.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">I will cover step recording later on.
For now my focus is on recording operations that can be performed
from the main window.</P>

<P> If you route the track to a MIDI device, (including the &quot;Synth
plugin&quot; device, if available), then the track will become a MIDI
track, and it can only be used to play MIDI segments.  If you drag an
audio segment onto this track by mistake, the audio will not play. 
Conversely, if you route a track to the &quot;JACK Audio&quot;
device, it will become an audio track, and it will not play any MIDI
segments you happen to drag here by mistake.
