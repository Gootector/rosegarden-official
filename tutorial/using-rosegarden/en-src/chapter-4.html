<H1>Managing &quot;Instrument Parameters&quot;</H1>
<P>Now that you understand have configured your default studio to
suit your own needs, you might be wondering just how to make use of
all those programs and controllers you set up. As I have mentioned in
various other places, program changes and controllers in MIDI work on
a channel level. That means they work on a track level within
Rosegarden. On the audio side of the aisle, Rosegarden divides audio
support into 16 channels as well, and channel-specific settings such
as volume levels and plugins can be configured at the track and
channel level as well.</P>
<H2>JACK Track or MIDI Track?</H2>
<P>When starting with a new track, or reconfiguring an existing one,
the first decision you need to make is whether the track will be used
for audio or MIDI. Regardless of whether you are displaying
connections or track labels, you begin by clicking the mouse cursor
in this area, and holding a moment until a menu appears.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/click-and-hold.png" NAME="Graphic3" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=231 HEIGHT=51 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
You should be presented with a series of nested menus that allow you
to choose the MIDI (or JACK) device and channel for the track.  Let's
have a look at MIDI first:</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
 This first layer of the menu tree allows you to route this track's
output to a particular device.  In this case, I chose to route it to
my Roland Sound Canvas.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/select-midi.png" NAME="Graphic4" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=253 HEIGHT=215 BORDER=0>
</P>
<P>Leaving the menu selection on &quot;Roland SC-33&quot; a moment
caused the menu on the far right to appear.  By selecting &quot;Roland
SC-33 #6 (Piano 1)&quot; from this final list, I assigned this track
to the same channel and instrument parameters settings already in use
by another track.  I could just as easily have assigned it to a
channel that had not yet been assigned elsewhere, and could have then
used the Instrument Parameters box to select a program change.  I
will discuss this last idea a bit later.</P>
<H3>What Do Those Black Boxes Mean?</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">The
column of small boxes to the left of the channel provide a concise
way of showing information about the status of these connections. In
the examples above, you might have noticed that they were in several
different states.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
These boxes convey the following information:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in"><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/using-rosegarden_html_72a37f4e.png" NAME="Graphic38" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=14 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0>
This instrument or device isn't very useful to you right now. It is
is <B>not in use</B> by a track, and it is <B>not connected</B> to
any active output path. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in"><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/using-rosegarden_html_3dc467bd.png" NAME="Graphic79" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=12 BORDER=0>
This instrument or device could provide a valid output path, and all
you need to do from here is attach it to a track and begin making use
of it. It <B>is connected</B> to an active output path, but it is <B>not
being used</B> by any track. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in"><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/using-rosegarden_html_1e7e4e7a.png" NAME="Graphic81" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=14 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0>
A track or tracks are connected to this device, but this is not
currently a valid output path, and the events on any tracks that are
connected don't have anywhere to go. This instrument or device is <B>in
use</B> by a track, but is <B>not connected</B> to an active output
path.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in"><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/using-rosegarden_html_e634bf.png" NAME="Graphic80" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=14 HEIGHT=16 BORDER=0>
This instrument or device provides a valid output path, and that path
is in use by at least one track. It <B>has a valid connection</B> to
an output path, and that connection is <B>in use</B> by a track.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
In addition, the instrument in use by the current track will have an
extra black outline around either a black filled or black outlined
box, depending on whether or not the path is connected to a valid
output:</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/using-rosegarden_html_500c240c.png" NAME="Graphic82" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=18 HEIGHT=18 BORDER=0>
The active track is connected to an output that is <B>also connected</B>.
If you play this track, you can expect the device you've hooked up to
make some noise.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/using-rosegarden_html_5204c333.png" NAME="Graphic83" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=18 HEIGHT=18 BORDER=0>
The active track is connected to an output that is <B>not connected</B>.
This track, on the other hand, won't make any noise until you assign
a different device to it or turn on the device that isn't currently
working.</P>
<H2 ALIGN=LEFT>MIDI Instrument Parameters</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">Now that
the track has been assigned to a MIDI output device, and is therefore
a MIDI track, the <B>Instrument Parameters</B> box will display
controls similar to these.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/instrument-parameters-midi-ins.png" NAME="Graphic2" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=190 HEIGHT=165 BORDER=0></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">They
allow you to reassign the channel for this track, and to dial in a
program.  In this case, you can see Roland's variation system in
action.  The program is set to &quot;20. Churg Org. 1&quot; and the
variation to &quot;17. Church Org. 3&quot; so this track will play
using a pipe organ sound that isn't part of the basic set of General
MIDI programs.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">If you
want to select a GS-style drum kit, your <B>Instrument Parameters</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">
box should look something like this:</SPAN></P>

<H2>Creating a JACK Track</H2>
<P>If you want to use a track for audio, you'll need to make it a
JACK track.  The idea is exactly the same as a MIDI track, except you
will only have one device to choose from, and it is called &quot;JACK
Audio.&quot;  (If you do not have a &quot;JACK Audio&quot; device
available, please ensure that your JACK server is running.  If you
have problems with this, see &quot;You Don't Know JACK&quot; later on
in this guide.)</P>

<H2>JACK Instrument Parameters</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">Audio
tracks have different controls available in the <B>Instrument
Parameters</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"> box.</SPAN>. They
allow you to control the routing of the audio, and to add layers of
plugins. There are redundant Mute, Solo and Record toggles, as well
as volume sliders for left and right</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">stereo
channels, and a mono/stereo toggle. (<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/audio-mono.png" NAME="Graphic8" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=24 HEIGHT=24 BORDER=0>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">If you
wish to assign plugins to the track, you may use one of the &quot;&lt;no
plugin&gt;&quot; buttons to summon a dialog similar to this one. 
These controls will vary considerably from plugin to plugin.  I will
cover plugins in more depth later on, in &quot;You Don't Know JACK.&quot;</P>

<H1>Recording Basics</H1>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">There are three different ways to
record with Rosegarden. If you come from a MIDI background, the most
obvious thing to do is plug in your MIDI keyboard and hit the record
button to record a MIDI segment in the currently-selected track. If
audio is your aim, you'll want to set your mixer recording source and
get to work. On the other hand, if you have all the keyboard skill of
a paraplegic chipmunk, like I do, you might be more interested in
step recording.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">I will cover step recording later on.
 For now my focus is on recording operations that can be performed
from the main window.</P>
