<i>Using Rosegarden</i> by D. Michael McIntyre.  This book attempts to cover
all the bases from getting sound working to doing creative things with
notation and the matrix editor.  It largely succeeds, although the work fell a
bit short of getting into some of the more esoteric nooks and crannies that
were planned, and it is a bit rough in places.  This is the final version, and
it is based on the official 1.0 release.  Subsequent editions may pick up
where this has left off, and will move toward describing whatever changes 1.1
and the future bring.
