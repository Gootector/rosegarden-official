select several segments in several tracks.  move them.  hit "undo move
segments" and only some of the segments move back, with the abandoned
segements no longer highlighted.  It gets out of synch at that
point, and the segments have to be put back in order manually.

file -> revert does not work

feature request:  solo button for transport in matrix and notation editors

notation editor:  Start with a short segment in, say, the middle of a track.
Open in Notation Editor.  Fiddle with Smoothing slider, then use Transforms >
Fix Smoothed Values.  Now the start of the segment has grown all the way to
the start of the composition.  The empty measures to the left do not get
padded with rests in the current view, nor if the Notation Editor is
re-loaded.  Not sure if this last is WAD or not.


notation editor:  select two segments.  edit as notation.  only one of them
renders correctly, and it's a big mess...

notation editor: text -> annotation...  shows text in black/yellow in dialog,
but no text appears in notation window.  Bug?  Feature?
