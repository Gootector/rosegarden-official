Rosegarden-4 v0.1
=================

Rosegarden-4 is a new sequencer and musical notation editor
application.  This is an early release of the application, intended
for potential developers and other interested parties.  It is not an
application that is usable by real users yet.

Note that Rosegarden-4 is largely not based on Rosegarden-2.1 code and
is not yet a solution for people who find Rosegarden-2.1 in any way
unreliable or limiting.  This program is far more unreliable and far
more limiting.


Build requirements
------------------

The big requirement is KDE.  This program depends on KDE 2.n for
n >= 1 (including the kdemultimedia package), and Qt 2.n for n >= 2.

Our code should compile with gcc-2.95 or gcc-3.0, although you may
find that KDE 2.n won't easily compile with the latter.


Compiling from source
---------------------

If you obtained the source code from the SourceForge CVS repository:

  This application is packaged in the same way as most other KDE
  applications.  Please consult the "COMPILING" file found in the KDE
  source code for a description of how to compile code from CVS.

  You may wish to run one of the developers' configure scripts such as
  "gl_configure"; you will first need to change the Qt and KDE2 install
  paths in the script according to your setup.  The most important
  thing in the script is

    CXXFLAGS="-g3 -gstabs+ -fexceptions"

  before the call to "configure", as we use exceptions in the code.

  After configuring, run "make" and, if the compile succeeds, "make
  install".  (The pixmaps need to be installed to the global KDE
  directories before the application will run correctly.)


If you obtained the source code from a distribution tarball: 

  Just run 

    ./configure

  plus appropriate "--with-qt-dir=..." and "--prefix=..." options.
  The prefix should be the same as the one of your KDE installation.
  Then proceed with "make" and "make install".


Running the application
-----------------------

Just run the "rosegarden" application (found in the KDE bin directory
after installation, and also in the gui/ directory of the source tree).

IMPORTANT NOTE: The application will probably crash when you attempt
to open an editing window, if you haven't installed it properly (using
"make install") before you run it.  This will be fixed... some time.

To get the sequencer working properly, please read
docs/howtos/artsd-mcop-notes for instructions.  The sequencer process
is started automatically when the gui is started, provided it has been
correctly installed (by "make install") in the global KDE directories.

You can also "make uninstall" to uninstall the application if you
decide it's a waste of your time.


Notes for developers
--------------------

We are actively seeking developers who are interested in coding new
parts of the application, adding features, and fixing bugs.  See
docs/task_lists/0.2_planned_tasks.txt for some idea of the things
we're already thinking about doing for the next developer release.
Good ideas are also welcome.

Be warned that we intend to be fairly strict about code quality... as
far as that's possible, given the not always superb standards of our
own code.


Documentation
-------------

All the documentation we have is in the docs/ subdirectory.  Good
starting-points include:

  docs/howtos/artsd-mcop-notes.txt -- notes on how to get sound

  docs/data_struct/units.txt
  docs/data_struct/sets.txt -- some terminology explained

  docs/discussion/0.2_planned_tasks.txt -- ideas for what to do next
