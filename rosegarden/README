About this release
------------------

Rosegarden 1.4.0 is a major feature release.

This is a particularly exciting release for the Rosegarden project.
It includes a number of interesting new features, many of which we
expect to build upon further in future releases.  It also contains
significant code contributions from a greater number of people than
any previous Rosegarden release, including D. Michael McIntyre, Pedro
Lopez-Cabanillas, Heikki Junes, Stephen Torri, Magnus Johansson, Vince
Negri and Martin Shepherd as well as Chris Cannam, Guillaume Laurent,
and a number of active translators.

Please see the release notes for details of new features in this
release.


Build requirements
------------------

The big requirement is KDE 3.1, or later, or more specifically the KDE 3.1+
development libraries (you don't need the whole KDE environment).

Our code compiles with gcc-3.x and gcc-4.x.

For MIDI support on Linux, you need ALSA 0.9.x or 1.0; for audio you
need JACK 0.77 or newer; for synth plugins you need DSSI 0.9.x or
newer; for synth plugin GUI support you need liblo 0.7 or newer.

We have recently switched from automake/autoconf/make to scons for
building.  Please see the section on Compiling from Source below for
details.


Compiling from source
---------------------

You will need to obtain and install scons.  If you are not familiar with
scons, it's a more modern alternative to "make".  See this page:

  http://scons.sourceforge.net/

For a typical end-user installation with no unusual requirements, simply run

  scons configure
  scons
  scons install

The build system should automatically detect your installation prefix
and various optional installed libraries with no further effort on
your part.  It will tell you if something it needs does not appear to
be available.

For special requirements, a few options are supported.  These take the
format scons configure option=[0|1], for example

  scons configure debug=1

To see a list of available options, use

  scons configure --help

To perform the equivalent of a "make clean" or "make distclean" use

  scons -c

To uninstall, use

  scons -c install

NOTE: The installation prefix should be the same as the one of your
KDE installation. However you can install to another directory, but
then you'll have to append it to your KDEDIRS variable. For instance :

KDEDIRS=/usr:/home/glaurent/rosegarden


Running Rosegarden
------------------

Just run the "rosegarden" application (found in the KDE bin directory
after installation).  The sequencer process is started automatically
when the gui is started, provided it has been correctly installed (by
"make install") in the global KDE directories.  If you have any
problems running the application, consult the FAQ:

  http://www.rosegardenmusic.com/resources/faq/

or if that doesn't answer your question then use the rosegarden-user
mailing list on SourceForge.

You can also "scons -c install" if you decide it's a waste of your time.


User documentation
------------------

There is a lot of documentation for Rosegarden available through the
Help menu.  Go to Help -> Rosegarden Handbook for the reference
manual, and Help -> Online Tutorial for a tutorial.


SPECIAL NOTES FOR PACKAGE MAINTAINERS
-------------------------------------

DSSI

Many distros released their packages of Rosegarden v1.0 compiled
without the optional DSSI/synth plugin support.  We received a lot of
complaints on our lists from your users and ours about your packages
being built without this feature.

We would like to request that you please take whatever steps are
necessary within the framework of your particular distro to ensure
that Rosegarden is built with DSSI support, and ideally that some of
the currently available DSSI plugins are also packaged for your
distro.  Thank you.  For details on DSSI, see:

  http://dssi.sourceforge.net/


Notes for developers
--------------------

We are actively seeking developers who are interested in coding new
parts of the application, adding features, and fixing bugs.  See the
bug and feature request trackers at SourceForge for inspiration.  If
you intend to do anything, please discuss it on the rosegarden-devel
mailing list (of course, providing working code will make your
argument extra persuasive).

Be warned that we tend to be fairly strict about code quality... as
far as that's possible, given the not always superb standards of our
own code.


Developer documentation
-----------------------

All the documentation we have (not enough) is in the docs/
subdirectory, including:

  docs/code/global_design.txt -- which classes do what, more or less
  docs/data_struct/units.txt -- how we store pitch and time
  docs/data_struct/sets.txt -- some terminology explained

  docs/howtos/alsa-notes -- brief notes about getting and installing the
	ALSA sound drivers (we recommend ALSA for use with Rosegarden)
  docs/howtos/artsd-mcop-notes.txt -- notes on how to get sound with aRts
	(not recommended!)
