Rosegarden-4 v0.1
=================

Rosegarden-4 is a new sequencer and musical notation editor
application.  This is an early release of the application, intended
for potential developers and other interested parties.  It is not an
application that is usable by real users yet.

Note that Rosegarden-4 is not based on Rosegarden-2.1 code and is not
yet a solution for people who find Rosegarden-2.1 in any way
unreliable or limiting.  This program is far more unreliable and far
more limiting.


Build requirements
------------------

The big requirement is KDE.  This program depends on KDE 2.1.1
(including the kdemultimedia package) and Qt 2.2.


To compile:
-----------

You probably won't be able to just run "configure"; instead you should
edit one of the developers' configure scripts such as "gl_configure"
script (you just need to change the Qt and KDE2 install paths
according to your setup) and run that.

Then run "make" and, if the compile succeeds, "make install".  (The
pixmaps need to be installed to the global KDE directories before the
application will run correctly.)


To run:
-------

Just run the rosegardengui application (found in the KDE bin directory
after installation, and also in the gui/ directory of the source tree).

To get the sequencer working properly, you need to use artsd and run
the separate rosegardensequencer process.  Please read
docs/howtos/artsd-mcop-notes for instructions.
