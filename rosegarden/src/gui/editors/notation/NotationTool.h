 * Notation tool base class.
 *
 * A NotationTool represents one of the items on the notation toolbars
 * (notes, rests, clefs, eraser, etc...). It handle mouse click events
 * for the NotationView ('State' design pattern).
 *
 * A NotationTool can have a menu, normally activated through a right
 * mouse button click. This menu is defined in an XML file, see
 * NoteInserter and noteinserter.rc for an example.
 *
 * This class is a "semi-singleton", that is, only one instance per
 * NotationView window is created. This is because menu creation is
 * slow, and the fact that a tool can trigger the setting of another
 * tool through a menu choice). This is maintained with the
 * NotationToolBox class This means we can't rely on the ctor/dtor to
 * perform setting up, like mouse cursor changes for instance. Use the
 * ready() and stow() method for this.
