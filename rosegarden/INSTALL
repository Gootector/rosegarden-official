Rosegarden 1.0 release notes
============================

ALSA 0.9.x/1.x support, JACK and LADSPA
=======================================

Rosegarden-4 supports ALSA (www.alsa-project.org) sound drivers as
default.  Any version above ALSA 0.9.0beta12 will do, although 1.0.6
or newer is recommended.

Full duplex audio is provided through the JACK library and server:

   http://jackit.sourceforge.net

Version 0.77 or newer is needed, but only if you want audio -- you
don't need JACK for MIDI.

Audio plugin support is provided courtesy of LADSPA:

  http://www.ladspa.org

and audio synth plugin support courtesy of DSSI:

  http://dssi.sourceforge.net
