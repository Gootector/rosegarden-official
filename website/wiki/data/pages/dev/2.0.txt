====ROSEGARDEN 2.0.0 (to be) RELEASED====

**IMPORTANT: THIS HAS NOT HAPPENED YET**

**This page is only a working area for making notes about what is being done for the 2.0 release, so that we don't forget anything when the code is finally ready to be released -- which will not be for some time yet.**


The Rosegarden team is proud to announce the release of version 2.0.0 of Rosegarden, an audio and MIDI sequencer and musical notation editor for Linux.  This is version 2.0.0 of the modern 21st century Rosegarden (formerly known as Rosegarden-4) and should not be confused with the old, obsolete X11 Rosegarden (formerly known as Rosegarden).

With this release, Rosegarden has become a modern Qt4 application that no longer uses the KDE libraries, which we hope will facilitate future maintenance.  The primary focus of this release has been the effort to port from Qt3 and KDE3 to Qt4, which was a very difficult, time-consuming job that involved a great deal of rewriting.  There should be as little difference as possible between this version and 1.7.3, and this is one release where no news is good news.  We will be able to take full advantage of Qt4 in future releases to offer a number of planned improvements.
