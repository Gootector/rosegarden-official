ROSEGARDEN 1.7.3 (to be) RELEASED

The Rosegarden team is proud to announce the release of version 1.7.3
of Rosegarden, an audio and MIDI sequencer and musical notation editor
for Linux.

  http://www.rosegardenmusic.com/

This is a bug fix release.

====New Features====
  * Emanuel 9051: Rosegarden can respond to live program and bank changes transmitted from, eg. your MIDI keyboard
  * Rosegarden Handbook updates from Shelagh Manton
  * (should I release the notation editor icons, or save them for 2.0?  I'm inclined to save them really, but that would be more work)


====Significant Bug Fixes====
 
  * Michael 9440: Fix multiple and single transposing recordings
     * When recording to multiple transposing tracks simultaneously (eg. an Eb cornet, a Bb trumpet and an F horn, as set up in Track Parameters) the performance is now adjusted correctly for all tracks, rather than just the first track
     * Fix a crash associated with the previous incorrect behavior
  * Chris 9442: Harden up TrackId handling to avoid assorted crashes related to deletion of track 1 (ID 0)
     * Make unset track IDs in MappedEvent etc default to something recognisably wrong, not just 0
     * Handle disappeared track ID in track parameter box.
     * Ensure track parameters box gets updated when a track is deleted
     * Fix a bug in Composition -- track deleted notification should have happened when a track was detached as well, not just when it was deleted and destroyed
  * Yves 9447: Fix a bug in TextEventDialog
     * The problem occurred when "Lyric" was selected in the text combo. Selecting anything else in this combo didn't remove the verse spinbox.
