====== The Future Rosegarden 2.0 ======

The end is closer every day.  After months of slogging, we finally have something tangible, and quite broken.

Rosegarden 2.0 <del>is primarily a Qt4 application, but it still depends on KDE4 for i18n()</del> is now a Qt4 application, but still uses some Qt3-compatibility classes, such as Q3Canvas to defer those major rewrite until after the obligatory rewrites have been accomplished.

===== Working environment =====

Here's how to check out, update, and test-build the "qt4" branch.

First you'll need the Qt4 and KDE4 headers.  On Ubuntu 8.04 this one line seems to be enough:

<code>
  $ sudo apt-get install kdelibs5-dev
</code>

Yes, that's a 5.

Then,

<code>
  $ svn co https://rosegarden.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/rosegarden/branches/qt4
  $ cd qt4
  $ make -f qt4-makefile 
  $ ./rosegarden
</code>

If that fails catastrophically, you probably need to edit qt4-makefile to adjust it to your environment.  Our CMake-based build system is still broken, though it will work eventually.  There is no need to install anything, as it is all encapsulated in the one rosegarden binary.

===== Bug tracker =====

We're not going to start using the SourceForge tracker to keep track of things until later in the process.  Instead, we've got this handy dandy [[dev:qt4_bug_tracker|Tracker Page]]
