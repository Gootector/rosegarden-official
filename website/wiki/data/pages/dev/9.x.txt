====== ROSEGARDEN 09.X (to be) RELEASED ======

**IMPORTANT: THIS HAS NOT HAPPENED YET**

**This page is only a working area for making notes about what is being done for the 09.x release, so that we don't forget anything when the code is finally ready to be released -- which will not be for some time yet.**


The Rosegarden team is proud to announce the release of version 09.x of Rosegarden, an audio and MIDI sequencer and musical notation editor for Linux.  This is version 9x of the modern 21st century Rosegarden (formerly known as Rosegarden-4) and should not be confused with the old, obsolete X11 Rosegarden (formerly known as Rosegarden).

With this release, Rosegarden has become a modern Qt4 application that no longer uses the KDE libraries, which we hope will facilitate future maintenance.  The primary focus of this release has been the effort to port from Qt3 and KDE3 to Qt4, which was a very difficult, time-consuming job that involved a great deal of rewriting.  There should be as little difference as possible between this version and 1.7.3, and this is one release where no news is good news.  We will be able to take full advantage of Qt4 in future releases to offer a number of planned improvements.

=====The Porting Team=====

We'd like to give special thanks to the following members and contributors, some old, some new, for their outstanding work on the long and difficult port.  These brave few are the authors of a new chapter in our history.

  * Chris Cannam
  * Michael McIntyre
  * Julie Swango
  * Emanuel Rumpf
  * Yves Guillemot
  * Chris "CJ" Fryer
  * Heikki Junes

===== Thanks To =====
  * Luis Garrido
  * David Willis

======New Features======
  * Ported to Qt4
  * Removed all ties to KDE for a lower dependency footprint
  * Stunning new look that is equally at home on KDE, GNOME, or any other Linux desktop
  * Most application resources are now bundled inside the application itself, reducing its installation footprint, and allowing you to run different versions (eg. a stable production version and a release candidate) in parallel without data file version conflicts
  * You can finally run more than one copy of Rosegarden at the same time
  * Completely new icons for the notation editor, and anywhere else we could benefit from true antialiasing as opposed to simple transparency
  * New MIDI device manager
  * Improved flashing metronome mode and more realistic looking LEDs for the transport
  * Markers now have a "Comment" instead of a "Description" to make it more clear which bit of text is going to show up on the marker ruler, and be exported to LilyPond


====Significant Bug Fixes====
 
  * Exporting project files to paths that have spaces no longer fails
  * Faders can now be moved in both directions with the mouse scroll wheel
  * Corrected LilyPond export of double octave clefs
