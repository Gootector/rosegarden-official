A low latency kernel is included as part of [[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuStudio/|Ubuntu Studio]]. If you are running any other variant of Ubuntu Feisty (eg. Kubuntu) you can [[http:///www.ubustu.com/globe/2007/05/23/add-ubuntu-studio-to-an-existing-ubuntu-install/#more-56|add the Studio components to your existing installation]].
