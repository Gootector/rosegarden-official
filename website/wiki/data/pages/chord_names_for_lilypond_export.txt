If you want to use the default LilyPond jazz chord names in your exported LilyPond file, you need to learn the proper syntax for entering chord names.

Firstly you need to write the pitch which is any of the letters that make up the music alphabet ''a'' through ''g''.
Then you may add the sharps and flats, if needed.

**Rosegarden** uses the standard **LilyPond** way of changing pitch with Dutch terms, this may confuse non-Dutch speaking users. "''is''" means sharp and "''es''" means flat. So a //c-sharp// will look like this - ''cis'', //c-flat// looks like this - ''ces''. Write it down and put it somewhere easy to find! 

You can make a double sharp by simply writing ''cisis'' and a double flat by writing ''ceses''.
