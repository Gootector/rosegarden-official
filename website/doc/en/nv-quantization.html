	<span class="application">Rosegarden</span> is a multi-purpose program: it is a notation
	editor, but it is primarily a sequencer and editor for
	performed music.  And in performance, of course, the times
	and durations of notes are rarely as precise as they are on
	a printed score.
      </p><p>
	This means that it's often desirable for <span class="application">Rosegarden</span> to do
	a lot of tidying of the basic note times and durations when
	attempting to make meaningful notes to show in the notation
	editor.  This is a kind of quantization, but a kind that
	requires a surprising amount of guesswork to do well.
	<span class="application">Rosegarden</span> includes a quantizer designed to do a slightly
	better job of this than the plain grid quantizer.
      </p><p>Applying
	quantization strictly for notation is rather unimaginatively
	referred to as “<span class="quote">notation quantization</span>”: it only
	applies to the notes you see and edit in notation, and
	doesn't affect the notes that play, or that you edit in
	other views such as the matrix.  This quantization is
	automatically applied to music imported or recorded from
	MIDI, although not all of its possible capabilities are
	enabled by default.
      </p><p>
	There are two ways to see which notes have been quantized
	for notation.  By default, each notation view contains a <a href="nv-rulers.html#nv-raw-note-ruler" title="The raw note ruler">raw
	    note ruler</a> (in the group of rulers above the score) showing
	a rectangular block for each note.  This block is positioned
	so as to represent the time and duration of the note as
	performed, but with the top and bottom edges of the
	rectangle extended or shortened to represent the time after
	notation quantization.  If this is too much information for
	you, you can alternatively choose (in the configuration
	dialog) to show in a green colour all note heads in the
	score that have had their timings altered by notation
	quantization.
      </p><p>

	</p><p>
	If the quantization <span class="application">Rosegarden</span> has used is not suitable,
	either for the entire score or for a selection of notes, you
	can choose to use a different level of quantization or none
	at all.  To apply a different quantization to some notes,
	select the notes and use the Quantize...
	menu function (tick the box labelled “<span class="quote">Quantize for
	  notation only</span>”).  The quantization level or type used
	by default can be changed in the configuration dialog.

		  most fundamental parameter.  A "complex" quantizer
		  will be more prepared to accept that complex-looking
		  music is in fact intended to be complex, whereas a
		  "simple" quantizer is more likely to assume that
		  complex-looking music results from an imprecise
		  performance of simple music.
		</p><p>The default setting is intended to produce
		  reasonable results for a fairly wide range of music.
		</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Base grid unit</span></dt><dd><p>The base grid unit (set to a note duration
		  value) specifies the absolute minimum unit of note
		  that will be permitted to remain in the score after
		  quantization.  For example, if set to a semiquaver,
		  all notes will be placed on boundaries of a multiple
		  of a semiquaver, with durations also a multiple of a
		  semiquaver.
		</p><p>The setting of the base grid unit is not quite
		  as significant for a notation quantizer as it is for a
		  plain grid quantizer, because all it does is impose an
		  absolute limit on the level of precision permitted by
		  the complexity parameter.  Mostly, when you find a
		  case in which increasing the grid unit produces better
		  results, you've actually found a case in which the
		  quantizer simply didn't do as good a job as it should
		  have been able to with the smaller unit.
		</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Tuplet level</span></dt><dd><p>The notation quantizer is capable of identifying
		  tuplets (triplets and other time-squashed groups),
		  within reasonable limits.  This parameter controls how
		  ambitious it will attempt to be when looking for
		  tuplets, by setting a limit on how many notes per
		  tuplet group it will attempt to identify.  If it is
		  set to “<span class="quote">None</span>”, the quantizer will not
		  attempt to identify tuplets at all.

		  Causes the notes to be re-beamed into groups
		  appropriately after quantization.  This is usually
		  desirable.
		</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Add articulations (staccato, tenuto,
		slurs)</span></dt><dd><p>
		  Causes the quantizer to attempt to identify, based
		  on the durations of individual and consecutive
		  notes, which notes should be notated with staccato
		  marks (for notes that fall significantly short of
		  the following note, but not apparently short
		  enough to merit a rest), tenuto (for notes that
		  almost or just overlap the following note) and
		  slurs (for series of notes that meet or overlap).
		</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Tie notes at barlines etc</span></dt><dd><p>Causes any notes that are still found after
		  quantization to overlap barlines or to have
		  durations not exactly expressible with single note
		  heads to be split into multiple notes appropriately,
		  and tied.  This has the same effect as applying the
		   "Tie Notes at Barlines" function
		  in the notation view.
		</p><p>
		  This parameter is not set by default because it
		  changes the number of note events, which is
		  undesirable when using <span class="application">Rosegarden</span> partly or
		  principally as a MIDI sequencer.
		</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Split-and-tie overlapping chords</span></dt><dd><p>
		  Causes overlapping notes to be split and tied, so
		  as to make strict chords with individual noteheads
		  tied as necessary.  This has the same effect as
		  applying the  "Split-and-Tie
		  Overlapping Chords" function in the notation view.
		</p><p>
		  This parameter is not set by default partly because
		  it changes the number of note events, which is
		  undesirable when using <span class="application">Rosegarden</span> partly or
		  principally as a MIDI sequencer.
