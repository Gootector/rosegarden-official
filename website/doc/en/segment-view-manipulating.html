	The main window contains a selection of "tools" for editing
	segments.  These are available from the main toolbar: first
	select the tool you want from the toolbar, and then click
	and drag on the segments on the main canvas.
      </p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="segment-view-selector"></a>The Select tool</h3></div></div></div><p>
	  The select tool	  <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="rg-select.png"></span>
          is actually a
	  multipurpose tool: it can be used to select, move, copy,
	  resize and create segments.</p><p>The most obvious use is
	  selection: select a single segment by clicking on it with
	  the select tool, or select several by clicking with Shift
	  held down, or by clicking in an empty area of the window and
	  dragging out an area.
	</p><p>To move segments with the select tool, simply click and
	drag on the segment.  To create copies, click and drag with
	Ctrl held down.  To resize a segment, click and drag on the
	right-hand edge of the segment.  To create new segments, click
	and drag on an empty area either with the middle mouse button
	or with the left mouse button and Ctrl held down.</p><p>
	  The select tool doesn't replace the other tools completely,
	  though — sometimes you need to be more precise about
	  which operation you intend, particularly when working on small
	  segments.
	</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="segment-view-move-resize"></a>Move and Resize tools</h3></div></div></div><p>To move a segment to a different start time or track,
	  use the move tool	  <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="rg-move.png"></span>
           and click and drag on the segment you want
	  to move.  If you hold down the Ctrl key while dragging, the
	  segment will be copied instead of moved.</p><p>To resize a segment, use the resize tool	  <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="rg-resize.png"></span>
           and click and drag on the right-hand end of the segment.
           Resizing a segment has the effect of extending or
           shortening it, by subtracting some of its contents or adding
           silence at the start or end.  If you hold down the Ctrl
           key, the segment will be <a href="segment-view-manipulating.html#segment-view-rescale" title="Stretching and squashing segments">rescaled</a> (stretched
           or squashed) instead of extended or shortened.</p><p>For both move and resize you can hold Shift for fine
	positioning, to avoid snapping to a particular grid position.
	</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="segment-view-rescale"></a>Stretching and squashing segments</h3></div></div></div><p>Resizing a segment normally makes it shorter or longer
        by subtracting content or adding some extra space.  However,
        by holding the Ctrl key while resizing, you can instead
        stretch or squash the contents of the segment.  You can also do this by selecting the segment and then using <span xmlns:doc="http://nwalsh.com/xsl/documentation/1.0" class="guiitem"><span class="guimenu">Segments</span></span>-&gt;<span xmlns:doc="http://nwalsh.com/xsl/documentation/1.0" class="guiitem"><span class="guimenuitem">Stretch or Squash...</span></span>.</p><p>
          For segments that contain MIDI events, this re-spaces the
          events so that they are spread across the new segment's
          duration, playing back faster or slower than before but in
          the same relative proportions.
        </p><p>
          For audio segments, this time-stretches the audio, altering
          its played speed without altering its pitch (as would happen
          if the audio was simply played back faster or slower).
          Time-stretching usually adds some audible artifacts as well,
          so the quality of your results may vary.
        </p><p>
          <span class="application">Rosegarden</span> does not alter the original audio file when
          time-stretching an audio segment, and if you rescale the same
          segment repeatedly it will always work from the original
          file instead of accumulating timestretching artifacts with
          each rescale.  You can rescale both mono and stereo audio.
        </p><p>
          (For reference, <span class="application">Rosegarden</span> uses a frequency-domain
          time-stretcher based on a phase vocoder with phase-locking
          at percussive transients.  This usually produces good
          results with stable harmonic sounds such as pads and basses
          as well as purely percussive sounds such as drum loops, but
          is less effective for composite material or music with soft
          or breathy note onsets.)

	  You can use the split tool
	  <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="rg-split.png"></span>
	  to split a single segment
	  into two separate segments.  To split your segment, select the
	  split tool and click on the segment you wish to split.

	  By default segments are split on the closest barline to the

	  while splitting the segment.

	  splits the selected segments on silences.
		  This function works slightly differently depending
		  on whether the selected segments contain audio or
		  MIDI data.  For audio segments, it offers you a
		  dialog in which you can choose a threshold below
		  which the segment is considered "silent"; it then
		  splits the segment whenever its amplitude falls
		  below this threshold.  For MIDI segments, it simply
		  splits the segment everywhere that a full bar of
		  silence occurs.

		  splits the currently selected segments into higher and
		    lower parts.

		  This function invokes a dialog allowing you to
		  choose a pitch as a "split point", and then splits
		  the selected segments in half with all the notes on
		  or above that split point in the "higher" segment
		  and all the notes below it in the "lower".

		</p><p>
		  If the music in the segment consists of two separate
		  parts (e.g. left and right hand piano parts) that
		  are not always completely on either side of a single
		  split point, you may with to select the "ranging
		  split-point" option.  If this is selected,
		  Rosegarden will attempt to track the two parts as
		  they move up and down, usually doing a slightly
		  better job of separating out notes that were
		  intended to lie in the two separate parts.

		</p><p>
		  The resulting segments are both created on the same
		  track, with one overlapping the other.
