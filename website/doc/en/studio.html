      knows about the sound systems attached to the computer.  This
      may include <span class="acronym">MIDI</span> and audio hardware and other sound software,
      and includes information about connections, configuration,
      <span class="acronym">MIDI</span> patches and so on.  The Studio is built-in to every
      composition you create with Rosegarden.</p><p>Three pieces of terminology are essential here:

	<div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Device</span></dt><dd><p>A “<span class="quote">device</span>”, as far as Rosegarden is
	      concerned, is simply something capable of producing
	      sounds.  This may be a MIDI or audio device.  MIDI
	      devices do not necessarily correspond directly to
	      physical MIDI ports: they are just things with names
	      that you can refer to, expected to work in particular
	      ways.  Configuration information such as MIDI patch maps
	      can be attached to devices.
	      </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Instrument</span></dt><dd><p>Each device has a number of
		“<span class="quote">instruments</span>”, each of which is assumed
		to make a particular sound.  These are the things that
		you can assign tracks to in order to choose which
		sound they play.  By default, a device contains 16
		instruments, created for you at startup: if the device
		is a MIDI device, then these will each be initialised
		to one of the 16 MIDI channels.  The instrument is
		where you set all the properties of a particular
		voice, such as program settings, reverb, volume etc.
	      </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Connection</span></dt><dd><p>While a MIDI device is simply a name and a
	      collection of configuration information, the
	      “<span class="quote">connection</span>” specifies which MIDI port it
	      is physically attached to.  This can be configured in
	      the <a href="studio-device-editor.html" title="Managing MIDI devices">MIDI device
	      manager</a>.  (Audio and synth plugin devices do not
	      have connections in the same way.)
	      </p></dd></dl></div>
      </p><p>For example, imagine a setup consisting of a PC with two
	physical MIDI ports, one of which has an external synth
	attached to it.  Here you would normally configure Rosegarden
	so as to have one MIDI device, corresponding to the synth.
	You could then configure this device with the correct name and
	patch map, and then specify a connection for it that
	corresponded to the relevant MIDI port on your soundcard.
	Each of the 16 default instruments on the device could then be
	configured with a suitable program, and you would then assign
	tracks to those.</p><p>
	In practice, Rosegarden will by default create a device for
	each of the available connections on startup.  So in the
	example above, two MIDI devices will be created by default
	even though you only need one.  You would generally then
	rename and apply patch maps to the first, and delete or
	simply not use the second.  Remember that there is no way
	for Rosegarden to know what synths you actually have plugged
	in to the MIDI ports on your computer: for this reason, the
	devices created at startup are just intended to be a default
	set, and it's up to you to ensure that the devices you
	configure match those you are really using.
      </p><p>Once configured, the studio setup is stored with every
	Rosegarden-format file you save.</p></div></div><div style="background-color: #white; color: black;                  margin-top: 20px; margin-left: 20px;                  margin-right: 20px;"><div style="position: absolute; left: 20px;"><a accesskey="p" href="infrared-remote-controls.html">Prev</a></div><div style="position: absolute; right: 20px;"><a accesskey="n" href="studio-device-editor.html">Next</a></div><div align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></div></div><div style="background-color: #white;   color: black;         margin-left: 20px;   margin-right: 20px;"><div class="navLeft">Infrared Remote Controls </div><div class="navRight"> Managing MIDI devices</div><div class="navCenter"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></div></div><br><br><div class="bannerBottom" style="background-image: url(bottom-middle.png);                                        background-repeat: x-repeat;                                         width: 100%;                                         height: 100px;                                         bottom:0px;"><div class="BannerBottomRight"><img src="bottom-right.png" style="margin: 0px" alt=""></div><div class="bannerBottomLeft"><img src="bottom-left.png" style="margin: 0px;" alt=""></div><div id="comments" style="position:relative; top: 5px; left: 1em; height:85px; width: 50%; color: #cfe1f6"><p>
