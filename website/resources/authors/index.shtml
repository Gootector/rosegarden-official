    <p>Rosegarden has three core developers, who between them are to
    blame for most of the application as you find it now.  Their email
    addresses are shown below in obfuscated form - change the "at" to "@"
    and the "dot" to "." to form the valid addresses.

    alt="Chris Cannam"/>Chris has been working on one incarnation or
    another of Rosegarden since the end of 1993.  It was then a
    university project for two students, devised by professor <a
    href="http://www.bath.ac.uk/~masjpf/">John Fitch</a> at the
    University of Bath, with <a
    href="http://www.all-day-breakfast.com/space/">Andy Green</a>
    working on the MIDI sequencer and Chris on the notation editor.
    They were the sole developers until late in 1995, some time after
    the barely-usable 1.0 release.</p><p>For Rosegarden-4, Chris is
    responsible for most of the notation rendering and some of the
    file and data code.  He lives in London and is currently working
    full-time on Rosegarden and related activities.</p>

    1995, when he was drafted in to take over the Unix sequencer.  He is
    responsible for almost all the MIDI, audio, sequencing and
    recording code in Rosegarden-4.</p><p>Richard works full-time on Rosegarden
    and related music and technology projects and is available to talk to
    about commercial and non-commercial activities involving music technology
    (including Rosegarden) and also to give demos.

    alt=" "/>Guillaume lives in Cannes, in the South of France.
    He's been using Linux since 1995, and first worked on
    Rosegarden in the summer of 1996, when he supplied a few hundred
    lines of new code in his first couple of emails.  Guillaume is
    responsible for getting the Rosegarden-4 project restarted, for
    creating the basic design and writing much of the GUI code and
    file and data framework, and for most of the project administration.

    <p>He has also helped maintain <a href="http://gtkmm.sourceforge.net/">Gtk--</a> for a while, and is
    involved in some parts of <a href="http://www.kde.org">KDE</a> here and there.  In his spare time,
    he works as a software engineer.
