    <h2>Documents</h2>

      <p>Rosegarden comes with some documentation in the form of a
      help system and tooltip help, and you may find the following <a
      href="http://rosegarden.sourceforge.net/tutorial/">offerings</a> helpful
  as well.</p>

      <h3>MIDI Device Program Maps</h3>
      
    <p>

    For those of you looking to create voice mappings for your own
    MIDI hardware, here is a <a href="rgd-HOWTO.shtml">mini-HOWTO for
    creating voice definitions for Rosegarden-4</a>.  You should also
    check out the ever-growing <a
    href="http://svn.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.cgi/rosegarden/trunk/rosegarden/gui/library/">device
    library</a> (a snapshot of which is included with each
    Rosegarden-4 release) to make sure your device hasn't already been
    mapped.
