    <h2>Tour 4: Audio</h2>

    <p>It's easy to mix audio clips with the rest of your composition:
    you can even drag-and-drop audio files from the KDE desktop
    straight onto the main window, and arranging audio tracks is just
    like arranging MIDI ones.  Move, snap, resize, zoom, repeat, and
    let Rosegarden's sample-accurate audio engine do the hard
    work.</p>

    <br>
    
    <p>There's a capable but straightforward audio mixer window to
    adjust levels and audio routing.  You can have as many audio
    tracks as your hardware will support, and route them through up to
    eight submaster groups with five insert effect slots per
    track.</p>

    <p>Rosegarden uses the Linux standard LADSPA plugin API, so it
    supports hundreds of existing free plugins &ndash; and for those
    with an engineering bent, the open and easy-to-learn plugin
    standard makes it a fun platform for studying signal processing
    and developing new effects.</p>
