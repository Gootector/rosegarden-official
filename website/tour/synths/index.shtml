    <h2>Tour 5: Synths</h2>

    <p>Rosegarden includes synth plugin support for sample-accurate
    synthesis of MIDI tracks.  The full audio effects plugin and
    mixing architecture is available for synth tracks as well, and
    with it you can be sure that your tracks will sound the way you
    intended no matter where you take them.</p>

    <br>
    
    <p>Rosegarden uses the <a href="http://dssi.sf.net/">DSSI</a>
    architecture for synth plugins, a public standard which permits
    each plugin to be controlled from its own custom GUI as well as
    Rosegarden's built-in plugin interface.</p>

	<p>
    And as well as plugins, Rosegarden can communicate with any number
    of standalone soft synths for Linux using the ALSA sequencer MIDI
    protocol.</p>
