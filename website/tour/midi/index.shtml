	<h2>Tour 2: MIDI</h2>

	<p>Rosegarden's Studio concept stores all the information you need about your MIDI network &ndash; what devices you have, what they're plugged in to, what banks, programs and controllers they support.  </p>
	<br>
	<div align="center"><img src="banks.png" style="max-width:100%"></div>
	<br>
<p>Setting up your Studio is easy: configurations for a number of well-known MIDI synths are included, or you can enter the details of your own MIDI devices and export the results into a Rosegarden device file to share with other users.</p>

	<p>Set up your Studio once, and then you can refer to your MIDI devices and their properties by name.  For example, right-click on a track label to assign a track to a MIDI device... </p>

	<p>... then you can set programs and control changes on that device using the right names and with different colours for the various controllers.</p>

	<p>And Rosegarden's Matrix editor also includes rulers for graphically editing control changes, as well as for velocity and pitch bend.</p>
