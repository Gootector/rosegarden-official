        <h1>Played Grace Notes Rendered as Chords</h1>

        <p>I promised to publish a recipe for dealing with the scenario in this
        <a
        href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1160944&group_id=4932&atid=104932">old
        bug report</a>.</p>

        <p>First, load the <a href="data/gracenote.rg">file from that report</a>
        and have a look at bar 5 in a notation view.</p>

        <p align=center>

        </p>

        <p>Ugly.  What's going on here?  The raw note ruler at the top only
        gives a tiny hint, and we probably need to have a look in the matrix for
        this one.</p>

        <p align=center>

        <p>There's the culprit.  The little &quot;grace&quot; note coming ahead
        of the beat, and straddling the barline.  Rosegarden is not sure what to
        do with this at all (although, helpfully, at least we circle the note
        now, which is an improvement over when this report was filed three years
        ago.)</p>

        <p>The best solution I can think of is to delete the little G#4 from the
        matrix, then go back to a notation view, go into <img
        src="pixmaps/grace02.png"> grace insert mode, and stick the note back in
        ahead of the longer note.</p>

        </p>

        <p>We'll just gloss over the fact that the # didn't show up, and all the
        weird rest problems that remain.  Nothing to see here.  Move along.
        These aren't the droids you're looking for.</p>
