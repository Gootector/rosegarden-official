        <h1>Copying Tempo and Time Signature Changes</h1>

        <p>I found this question on the user list this morning:</p>

        <blockquote><tt><p>Hello,</p>

        <p>My music is often composed of sequences of Time Signatures which follows
        one to another. For example: 7/8 9/8 9/8 7/8 7/8 7/8 7/8 9/8.
        I've never found a way to copy this "time signatures pattern" so that I
        don't have to set the 8 signatures in every sequence (if the sequence is
        repeating 8 times, it begins to be a bit boring).</p>

        <p>Actually, the result is that I have been writing some sequences only one
        time when I want thstrong to be played twice or more, and I've told the
        musicians how it worked.</p>

        <p>But I now must fix the .rg files so that we can play on it as a
        metronome/"t&eacute;moin" for recording. Thus, I have to know how to propagate
        this "time signatures patterns", and, moreover, I have to figure out how
        to slide bunches of segments/time signatures changes/tempo changes,
        and so on some bars further.</p>

        <p>Could someone help me on this?</p>

        <p>Thank you very much.</p></blockquote></tt>

        <h2>Example Copied</h2>

        <p>Let's begin by implementing the suggested example time signature
        pattern of <tt>&quot;7/8 9/8 9/8 7/8 7/8 7/8 7/8 9/8.&quot;</tt>  For
        illustrative purposes, we'll also insert tempo changes with each time
        change, to demonstrate how both of these can benefit from the same
        mechanism, and to make it easier to see the time blocks at a glance.</p>

        <p>I entered everything with the Tempo and Time Signature Editor,
        yielding the following result:</p>
        
        <p align=center>
        <img src="pixmaps/tt01.png">
        </p>

        <p>From here, the final <tt>9/8</tt> continues to the end of the
        document in perpetuity.  If we want to repeat this pattern of time (and
        tempo) changes to begin anew at bar 9, we can do it the hard way, by
        repeating the series of steps that lead us to this current result, or we
        can exploit the range copy/paste mechanism to make the process less
        tedious.  (There was a nasty bug in this mechanism in 1.7.0, so I
        suggest using a version either earlier or later than this, which as of
        this writing means 1.6.1 or a recent build of the SVN trunk.)</p>

        <p>First, we need to define a range that spans the eight bars in
        question.  There are two ways to accomplish this.  You can
        <strong>Shift+Click</strong> and drag on the ruler to draw out the white
        loop/range selection bar, or you can position the blue playback cursor
        at the start of the range, then use the <img src="pixmaps/tt02.png">
        button on the transport, and finally reposition the cursor to the end of
        the range, and use the <img src="pixmaps/tt03.png"> button to finish the
        loop/range.</p>

        <p align=center>
        <img src="pixmaps/tt04.png">
        </p>

        <p><i>Or you can cheat and just load <a href="data/tempo_time.rg">this
        file</a></i></p>

        <p>Having thus defined the range, we can now copy it with <strong>Edit ->
        Copy Range</strong> or <strong>Ctrl+Shift+C</strong></p>

        <p align=center>
        <img src="pixmaps/tt05.png">
        </p>

        <p>Now move the blue cursor to the start of bar 9 (if it isn't already
        there) and <strong>Edit -> Paste Range</strong> or
        <strong>Ctrl+Shift+V</strong> to paste it.</p>

        <p align=center>
        <img src="pixmaps/tt06.png">
        </p>

        <p>The pattern of time and tempo changes has been duplicated
        successfully from 9 to 16.  Now repeat as required to achieve the
        desired result.  <em>NOTE: The range copy/paste mechanism not only grabs
        tempo and time signature changes as demonstrated here in this otherwise
        empty composition, but also events in all segments on all tracks in the
        area defined by the range.</em></p>

        <h2>Inserting a Copied Range</h2>

        <p>Moving on from the preceding example, let's say we want to insert a
        block of time and tempo changes (and any other events in all segments on
        all tracks occurring at this time) at bar 5, sliding the existing events
        out of the way.</p>

        <p>First, let's draw a segment from 1 to 17 in order to make it easier
        to see the results of the operation to follow:</p>

        <p align=center>
        <img src="pixmaps/tt07.png">
        </p>

        <p>Now let's define a range from 8 to 11, and copy it:</p>

        <p align=center>
        <img src="pixmaps/tt08.png">
        </p>

        <p>Now move the blue cursor to bar 5, and paste the range:</p>

        <p align=center>
        <img src="pixmaps/tt09.png">
        </p>

        <p>This segment is empty, and there are no audible results, but we can
        see that the original segment has been cut into three pieces, with a
        copy of a bit of itself inserted beginning at bar 5.  The tempo and time
        signature changes have been copied and inserted here as well.</p>

        <p align=center>
        <img src="pixmaps/tt10.png">
        </p>

        <h2>Inserting an Empty Range</h2>

        <p>The final use for this feature is to insert some empty space at an
        arbitrary point in the middle of something else.  Let's say we want to
        insert three empty bars starting at bar 3.</p>

        <p>First, move the blue cursor to bar 3.  Then use <strong>Edit ->
        Insert Range</strong> or <strong>Shift+Insert</strong>, which will
        produce a &quot;Duration of empty range to insert&quot; dialog.  I have
        set my dialog to insert the three empty measures just discussed:</p>
        
        <p align=center>
        <img src="pixmaps/tt11.png">
        </p>

        <p>In the final result, we can see that there is now a three-bar hole in
        the example segment, showing us where the empty range has gone.
        <em>NOTE: the empty range will have whatever time signature is in effect
        at the point of insertion.  It is not possible to insert an empty range
        that contains multiple time signatures.  To do this, copy a block of
        time signatures from somewhere else, and paste them here to insert them
        instead.</em></p>

        <p align=center>

        <p>The end!  I hope this answered your question in a satisfactory manner.</p>
