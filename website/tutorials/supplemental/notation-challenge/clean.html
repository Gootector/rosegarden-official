	<h5>This tutorial was written using a pre-release version of Rosegarden
	1.7.0.</h5>

        <h1>Let Rosegarden Help You Adapt Parts for Real Instruments</h1>

        <p>This is more of a footnote than something that really belongs here in
        the Notation Challenge, but I randomly stumbled across this example
        while I was hunting for something else.  <a href="data/ultima.rg">This
        file</a> presents a great opportunity to play with one of 1.7.0's cooler
        features.  I wrote the thing for Eriadain, an apparently abandoned
        attempt at remaking Ultima IX.  It was intended to be computer game
        music, and I didn't give the slightest care to playability on real
        instruments.</p>

        <p>It so happens that the flute part, in particular, is completely
        insane.  Rosegarden has had a segment parameter preset database since I
        came up with the idea in 2006, but it was impossible to use it for
        situations like this, because they could only be used when creating
        future segments.  Now in 1.7.0 it is finally possible to use them to
        help you sort out messes like this one.</p>

        <p>So...  Open <a href="data/ultima.rg">the file</a> and let's have a
        look at that flute part (open in a notation view, and scroll to bar 42):</p>

        <p align=center>
        <img src="pixmaps/clean00.png">
        </p>

        <p>That looks really high.  Is that playable?  I play a flute, and I
        don't think that's playable unless maybe in the hands of some bleeding
        edge avant garde player using alternate fingering.  But let's prove it.
        Go to <b>Track Parameters</b>, enable the <b>Create segments with</b>
        controls...</p>

        <p align=center>
        <img src="pixmaps/clean01.png">
        </p>

        <p>Then click the Load button, and dial up a flute:</p>

        <p align=center>
        <img src="pixmaps/clean02.png">
        </p>

        <p>Pay special attention to make sure you <img src="pixmaps/clean03.png"> and
        then go have another look in a notation view:</p>


        <p align=center>
        <img src="pixmaps/clean04.png">
        </p>

        <p>Ouch!</p>

        <p>So what happens if we change this for a piccolo instead?  Go back to
        the Load button and pick a piccolo.  The notation view updates
        instantly, taking a new transposing clef, and we see that this part is
        well within the capabilities of that instrument.</p>

        <p align=center>
        <img src="pixmaps/clean05.png">
        </p>

        <p>Now, how about the bassoon?  Out of the box, it's hard to say.  It
        looks like the part might be a little too low, but I don't play
        bassoon.</p>

        <p align=center>
        <img src="pixmaps/clean06.png">
        </p>

        <p>Rosegarden says yes, that's right.  It's a little too low.  Either
        this part comes up, or it has to be aimed at a contrabassoon
        instead.</p>

        <p align=center>
        <img src="pixmaps/clean07.png">
        </p>

        <p>Changing to a contrabassoon is as easy as picking something else off
        the Load button, but let's be realistic.  It's hard enough to get
        somebody to play your work (if you were eating on what you make as a
        composer, you probably wouldn't be using Rosegarden after all!) and a
        cheap student contrabassoon is over $8,000. Ouch.  If you don't know
        someone, who has one of these monsters in the closet somewhere, you are
        probably best off to transpose the entire piece to a key that puts these
        bassoon notes in line.</p>

        <p>Back up to the beginning, and <b>Segment -> Add Key Change</b>...</p>

        <p align=center>
        <img src="pixmaps/clean08.png">
        </p>

        <p>Take special note of all three options sections, because we want this
        key change in all non-percussion segments at this time, and we want to
        transpose everything into this key.</p>

        <p align=center>
        <img src="pixmaps/clean09.png">
        </p>
        <p align=center>
        <img src="pixmaps/clean10.png">
        </p>
        <p align=center>
        <img src="pixmaps/clean11.png">
        </p>

        <p>It turns out that going to four sharps still didn't do the
        trick.</p>

        <p align=center>
        <img src="pixmaps/clean12.png">
        </p>

        <p>Normal humans hate to play in more than four sharps, so what if we go to
        four flats?  Now that there is a key change present, you can go back and
        double click on it for a different version of the dialog.</p>

        <p align=center>
        <img src="pixmaps/clean13.png">
        </p>

        <p>As it happens, I never found a key that made me happy, and I am now
        officially bored with this example.  You get the idea though.  Have
        fun!</p>
