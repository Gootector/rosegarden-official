        <p>
	I have encountered a number of things over the years that I felt should
	be mentioned in some kind of tutorial.  The Rosegarden Notation
	Challenge is a way for me to deal with interesting isolated cases as I
	encounter them.  For example, I have a <a
	href="../piano/index.html">piano tutorial</a>, but the
	specific example I chose missed out on dealing with repeats and
	alternate endings.  I have an <a
	href="../fidelio/index.html">orchestral score tutorial</a>, but it
	didn't seem worthwhile to take the time to lead you through every aspect
	of correcting the notation, and so I missed the opportunity to
	demonstrate how to handle the opposing phrasing slurs toward the
	beginning of that piece.  I have decided to collect such examples here,
	and present them case by case.
