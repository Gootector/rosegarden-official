	<h3>Rosegarden Companion</h3>

        <p><img src="pixmaps/english-cover-small.png" align=left>

    <b><i>Rosegarden Companion</i></b>, by D. Michael McIntyre,  was the
    definitive companion guide and tutorial which showed you how to unleash the
    power of Rosegarden 1.0.  You might still be able to find a copy for sale,
    but the book is now out of print, and the publisher is not interested in
    doing an updated edition.</p>

	<a href="en/chapter-0.html">Rosegarden Companion in HTML</a>
    </h3>
    <p>This is the last snapshot of the old, free documentation, before the book
    deal.  I revised and expanded this core to prepare the manuscript for
    publication.  Unfortunately, I have no legal way of making the full
    manuscript available, and all that additional work seems to be lost now.

    <h2>Supplemental Tutorials</h2>

    <p><h3><a href="supplemental/chordnames/index.html">Lead Sheets with
    LilyPond</a></h3>
    This tutorial explains how to use Rosegarden 1.7.2 and up to create lead
    sheets using Rosegarden in conjunction with LilyPond.</p>

    <p>
      <h3><a href="supplemental/piano/index.html">Piano Notation by
      Example</a></h3>
      This tutorial leads you step by step through the process of importing a
      piano and vocal performance MIDI file, and correcting the resulting
      notation as much as possible.  The piano part has multiple voices in both
      hands, and there are several verses of lyrics, so this tutorial addresses
      multiple topics that should be of interest to nearly every notation user.
    </p>

    <p>
      <h3><a href="supplemental/fidelio/index.html">A Romantic
      Overture</a></h3>
      This tutorial begins with a performance MIDI file of Beethoven's Fidelio
      Overture, and leads you through the process of importing it, adapting the
      notation to real instruments, and creating both a conductor score and
      individual player parts.

    <h3><a href="supplemental/notation-challenge/index.html">The Rosegarden Notation
      Challenge</a></h3>
    I have encountered a number of things over the years that I felt should be
    mentioned in some kind of tutorial, but which didn't justify standing on
    their own.  The Rosegarden Notation Challenge is a way for me to deal with
    interesting isolated cases as I encounter them.
