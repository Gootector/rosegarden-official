<H1><A NAME="11">11 Appendix A: MIDI Primer</A></H1>
<P>MIDI stands for Musical Instrument Digital Interface. It is a simple
 serial protocol that electronic instruments and computers can use to
 talk to each other. MIDI-capable instruments vary enormously in their
 capabilities and complexity, ranging from simple analog synthesizers to
 pipe organs to electronic guitars, and even to electronic woodwinds and
 brass instruments.</P>
<P>MIDI-capable instruments aren't required to have much in common, but
 there are a several categories of characteristics that most of them
 share.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="11_1">11.1 Channels</A></H2>
<P>If you have a cable TV, you can receive more than one television
 channel over the same wire. MIDI channels behave in a similar fashion.
 Any one MIDI cable can be used to carry up to 16 channels of
 information. Most common modern equipment is capable of receiving on
 all 16 of these channels simultaneously, and many types of equipment
 can also transmit on more than one channel.</P>
<P>These channels work something like the tracks in Rosegarden, which is
 why channel assignment is done at the track level (through
 instruments). If you set the reverb level for channel 3, this setting
 will (typically) only affect notes that are transmitted on channel 3.
 Channels are similarly useful for playing different instruments at the
 same time, over the same cable, or for playing using different voices
 on a single instrument.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="11_2">11.2 Programs</A></H2>
<P>Most common MIDI instruments are polyphonic and multi-timbral. This
 means that they can play more than one note at the same time, and they
 can play notes using different voices. Many instruments try to simulate
 a proverbial band-in-a-box by offering a range of sounds ranging from
 piano through the orchestra into synthesized and ethnic sounds. These
 simulated instruments are called either &quot;programs&quot; or &quot;patches.&quot;</P>
<P>In the most common MIDI standard, General MIDI (GM), instruments must
 be able to play using any of 127 different programs. Music written to
 be performed on one GM instrument should sound similar on any other.
 The GM specification dictates that channel 10 will play drum sounds,
 and it defines a standard arrangement of keys on the keyboard to
 represent different drums.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="11_3">11.3 Banks</A></H2>
<P>Beyond the GM standard, many instruments have banks of additional
 programs. Each bank can contain an additional 127 programs. The MIDI
 specification allows for a monumental number of different banks, but
 most instruments arrange banks in two common ways. The two most common
 standards for this expansion of GM are called GS (Roland) and XG
 (Yamaha.) The usual General MIDI programs are in the first bank, and
 the extra programs are found in additional banks. Each bank has a
 unique identifying number using a combination of two parameters. They
 are Least Significant Byte (LSB) and Most Significant Byte (MSB). The
 standard GM bank on every GM-compliant synth has an LSB/MSB address of
 0 0.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="11_4">11.4 Controllers</A></H2>
<P>MIDI allows for 127 controllers. These controllers typically work at
 a channel level, and are used to control things such as pan (how far to
 the left or right the sound will play), volume (the overall maximum
 volume for the channel), pitch bend (used to simulate guitar and
 harmonica bends, play quarter tones, as well as numerous other uses),
 reverb (makes notes on the channel sound like they're in a concert
 hall) and sustain (causes the note to keep playing unhampered until the
 sound finally dies away, like the sustain pedal on a piano). There is
 enormous variability in this area, and you will find some equipment
 that ignores them all, while other instruments will use nearly all 127
 of them. You will need to know what kind of controllers your equipment
 (or software synth) supports if you are to configure Rosegarden to make
 use of them, though it does come out of the box aware of a very limited
 subset of the most common controllers.</P>
