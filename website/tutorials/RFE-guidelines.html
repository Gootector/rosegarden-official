<H1>Feature Request Guidelines</H1>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Feature requests are less critical to our
operation than bug reports, and we are therefore commensurately less
nitpicky about the whole process.  Nevertheless, you increase the
odds that someone might implement your brilliant new idea someday if
you bear the following guidelines in mind when submitting new Feature Requests.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<H2>Check for Similar Feature Requests</H2>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Go to our Feature Request tracker at
	<A HREF="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=4932&amp;atid=354932">https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=4932&amp;atid=354932</A>
		</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Try to come up with a word or
	expression that anyone who submitted this idea previously would have
	used in the description.  You have a better chance of finding the
	previous Feature Requests if you use terms that are as generic and simple as
	possible.  SourceForge will not return any hits unless it finds <B>all</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">
	of the terms you enter in one of the Feature Request summaries, and it cannot
	search the text of the reports directly.  Consequently, a search for
	&ldquo;audio&rdquo; or &ldquo;audio segment&rdquo; is more likely to
	find something than a search for &ldquo;audio segment resize idea.&rdquo;
	 Bear in mind spelling differences between the US and the rest of
	the English speaking world as well.  SourceForge won't find reports
	about &ldquo;colour&rdquo; that were submitted by an American who
	spelled it &ldquo;color,&rdquo; and so on.</SPAN></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Input your search into the
	&ldquo;Summary keyword:&rdquo; box.  Hit the &ldquo;Browse&rdquo;
	button.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If there were no results, go back
	and try other keywords until you run out of ideas, or until you get
	sick of wrestling with the lousy search facility at SourceForge.  We
	appreciate your making an effort to find existing reports, but we
	don't expect you to waste an hour of your life trying to coax
	something out of that admittedly very lame search facility either.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If you did find a result, or
	results, read through the previous reports and see if your Feature Request is
	already described.  If it is not described to your satisfaction, you
	can add additional comments to existing reports, if appropriate.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If there is no previous work to
	draw on, then you should continue on to file a new Feature Request.</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<H2>Submit a New Request</H2>
<P>Once you have made a reasonable effort to ensure that you have
discovered a new idea, then please continue with the following
guidelines in mind.</P>
<H3>Feature Requests to Avoid</H3>
<P>Porting to Windows and doing a GTK2 rewrite have both been
requested to death, and both are about as likely as waking up in the
morning to find out your house transmuted into solid gold while you
were sleeping.  Requests involving dramatic and fundamental changes
to the way Rosegarden behaves are very unlikely to be considered.  We
use Rosegarden too, and we mostly like it this way, and we mostly
built it the way on purpose, so try to be realistic.</P>
<H3>Don't Be a Nobody</H3>
<P>Please take the time to create a SourceForge account for yourself
and use it for submitting and tracking your Feature Requests.  The process of
working out an implementation of a new idea works best when you make
yourself available for followup questions, and when you take an
active interest in looking after your report.  Having said that, it
is less important for you to be held accountable when making feature
requests than when you are submitting bug reports.</P>
<H3>One Feature Request per Report</H3>
<P>You should avoid the temptation to save yourself effort by
combining different ideas into one massive report.  If there are
three related aspects to the same overriding problem, then file each
of these aspects separately.  Under no circumstances should you ever
file a &ldquo;big Feature Request list&rdquo; report that reels off a laundry
list of separate, unrelated ideas.</P>
