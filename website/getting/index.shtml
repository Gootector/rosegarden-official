    <h2>How to get Rosegarden</h2>

    <p>The Rosegarden development team currently only makes Rosegarden
    available in <a href="#source">source code form</a>, to be compiled after download.</p>

    <p>Installable binary packages for many major Linux distributions
    including Mandriva, Debian (package "rosegarden4"), Ubuntu,
    ALT Linux and PCLinuxOS are available from those distributions'
    downloadable package repositories.  Please consult your
    distribution's documentation for more details, and check that your
    distribution provides the latest available version (currently
    Rosegarden-4-1.0) before downloading.  RedHat/Fedora users may
    wish to consider the excellent <a
    href="http://www-ccrma.stanford.edu/planetccrma/software/">PlanetCCRMA</a>
    audio software package set.</p>

    <p>Because of the complexity of Rosegarden and its dependency on
    numerous other C and C++ libraries and services that vary from one
    distribution to another, it is sadly not practical at this time
    for the Rosegarden team to provide installable packages for the
    many Linux distributions available.</p>

    <h2>Fervent Software's Studio to Go!</h2>

    <p><b>Studio..<i>to go!</i></b> is a commercial package of music
    software with a Linux distribution on a single bootable Live CD,
    with support, produced by Rosegarden developers.  Rosegarden is of
    course included, along with a wide selection of other software all
    configured and ready to go.  This is almost certainly the easiest
    way to get a complete Rosegarden configuration, particularly if
    you aren't a Linux user already.  <a

    <h3>Current stable release</h3>

	<p><i>Note: please read the <a
	href="/getting/requirements/">Hardware and System Requirements
	page</a> to find out whether Rosegarden will work on your
	system, and read the README file in the downloaded package for
	details of how to compile.</i></p>

release 1.0 source code</a>, 14th February 2005, for download from the
SourceForge page.</li></ul>

    <h3>CVS development versions</h3>

    <p>The latest, up-to-the-minute source code in use by Rosegarden
    developers is always available by anonymous CVS from SourceForge.
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=4932">Please read
    the instructions here</a> for more details.  Note that this is
    always a work in progress, that might not build or run.</p>

    <h3>CVS branches</h3>

    <p>Several "branches" of the Rosegarden source code are available
    in CVS, containing different features for prospective developers
    or other interested parties.  You can choose one of these by
    adding the option "<code>-r </code><i>branchname</i>" to the end
    of your CVS <code>checkout</code> or <code>update</code>
    command.</p>

    <p>The current
    active branches are:

    <ul><li><b>HEAD</b> - This is the default CVS branch used when no
    other branch name is given.  This contains the code that will
    ultimately become the next official stable release of Rosegarden,
    although of course that doesn't mean it'll be stable now.  (You
    can return to this branch after updating from another one, with the
    "cvs update -A" command.)</li>

    <li><b>guitar_chord_editor</b> - This contains experimental
    development aimed at adding guitar chord fretboard editing and
    printing within Rosegarden (by Stephen Torri).  Note that this
    branch may be significantly out-of-date compared to HEAD in all
    areas other than the guitar fretboard code.</li>

    <li><b>glasgow_pitchtracker</b> - This contains extensive custom work to support the <a
    href="http://markov.music.gla.ac.uk/CMT/cmt.py/Projects/rgtracker.html">University
    of Glasgow Pitch Tracker project</a>.  Note that this
    branch may be significantly out-of-date compared to HEAD in all
    areas other than the pitch tracker support.</li>

    <li><b>experiments</b> - This is a general scratch area for
    developers, that may contain daring experimental work of all
    kinds.  The only limitation is that it should preferably still
    compile.  Changes to this branch will usually be notified on the
    Rosegarden development mailing list.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Note that we have changed build system (from automake to scons)
    recently, and some of these branches still use the old system
    while others use the new.  Check the README for details.</p>

<h3>"X11 Rosegarden" 2.1 releases</h3>

<p>Before the current Rosegarden project, there was another
Rosegarden: a now rather antique program, simpler, less powerful but
also less resource-hungry.  We're calling it "X11 Rosegarden" here, to
distinguish it from the newer Rosegarden.  It was originally written
for Silicon Graphics IRIX machines, and then ported to Linux and other
Unix variants.  If you're interested, you can still get it in source
code form right here.

only</a> (24K). This patch also includes some of the fixes in 2.1pl2.  It should be
applied to the original 2.1 sources; it will not apply correctly to
2.1pl2 or pl3.
