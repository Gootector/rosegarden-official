    <h2>How to get Rosegarden</h2>

    <p>The Rosegarden development team currently only makes Rosegarden
    available in <a href="#source">source code form</a>, to be compiled after download.</p>

    <p>Installable binary packages for many major Linux distributions
    including Mandriva, Debian (package "rosegarden4"), Ubuntu,
    ALT Linux and PCLinuxOS are available from those distributions'
    downloadable package repositories.  Please consult your
    distribution's documentation for more details, and check that your
    distribution provides the latest available version (currently
    Rosegarden-1.4.0) before downloading.  RedHat/Fedora users may
    wish to consider the excellent <a
    href="http://www-ccrma.stanford.edu/planetccrma/software/">PlanetCCRMA</a>
    audio software package set.</p>

    <p>Because of the complexity of Rosegarden and its dependency on
    numerous other C and C++ libraries and services that vary from one
    distribution to another, it is sadly not practical at this time
    for the Rosegarden team to provide installable packages for the
    many Linux distributions available.</p>

    <h2>Fervent Software's Studio to Go!</h2>

    <p><b>Studio..<i>to go!</i></b> is a commercial package of music
    software with a Linux distribution on a single bootable Live CD,
    with support, produced by Rosegarden developers.  Rosegarden is of
    course included, along with a wide selection of other software all
    configured and ready to go.  This is almost certainly the easiest
    way to get a complete Rosegarden configuration, particularly if
    you aren't a Linux user already.  <a

	<p><i>Note: please read the <a

	system, and read the README file in the downloaded package for

SourceForge page. <i>(<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=448654&group_id=4932">release note</a>)</i></li></ul>

    <h3>Development code from Subversion</h3>

    <p>The latest, up-to-the-minute source code in use by Rosegarden
    developers is always available using the Subversion (svn) source-code
    control system from SourceForge.  <a
    href="http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=4932">Please read the
    instructions here</a> for more details.  Note that this is always
    a work in progress, that might not build or run.</p>

    <p>You can also browse the source code in Subversion <a
    href="http://svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/rosegarden/trunk/rosegarden/">here</a>.</p>

    <h3>Subversion branches available</h3>

    <p>Several "branches" of the Rosegarden source code are available
    in Subversion, containing different features for prospective developers
    or other interested parties.  These branches are accessible in the
    <code>branches/</code> directory of the svn repository, with the
    following command :</p>
    <p><code>svn co https://rosegarden.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/rosegarden/branches/&lt;BRANCH&gt;/rosegarden rosegarden</code></p>
    <p>replacing <code>&lt;BRANCH&gt;</code> with the name of the branch you want.</p><p>The main branch (trunk) is accessible with</p>
    <p><code>svn co https://rosegarden.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/rosegarden/trunk/rosegarden rosegarden</code></p>

    <p>Note that the above commands will check out only the Rosegarden
    source code part of the Subversion repository.  If you want to get
    the whole of the available Rosegarden Subversion tree, including
    our paltry developer documentation and the HTML for this website,
    you can remove the "/rosegarden" from the end of the URL part of
    the above, e.g.:</p>

    <p><code>svn co https://rosegarden.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/rosegarden/trunk rosegarden</code></p>

    <p>The current
    active branches are:

    <ul><li><b>trunk</b> - Not a branch strictly speaking, the svn trunk
    is where most of the development happens.  This contains the code that will
    ultimately become the next official major release of Rosegarden.
    It is likely to vary between horribly unstable and quite stable,
    depending on how far away the next major release is.</li>

    <li><b>stable_<i>&lt;version&gt;</i></b> - This is the branch used
    to collect bug fixes for the next stable minor release.  It is
    branched from the point where the previous major feature release
    was completed.  The most recent stable branch was
    <b>stable_1_2_4</b>, but use of this branch ended with the release
    of 1.2.4 and a new stable branch has not yet been opened.</li>

    <li><b>glasgow_pitchtracker</b> - This contains extensive custom work to support the <a
    href="http://markov.music.gla.ac.uk/CMT/cmt.py/Projects/rgtracker.html">University
    of Glasgow Pitch Tracker project</a>.  Note that this
    branch may be significantly out-of-date compared to the trunk, in all
    areas other than the pitch tracker support.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Note that we have changed build system (from automake to scons)
    recently, and some of these branches may still use the old system
    while others use the new.  Check the README for details.</p>

<h3>"X11 Rosegarden" 2.1 releases</h3>

<p>Before the current Rosegarden project, there was another
Rosegarden: a now rather antique program, simpler, less powerful but
also less resource-hungry.  We're calling it "X11 Rosegarden" here, to
distinguish it from the newer Rosegarden.  It was originally written
for Silicon Graphics IRIX machines, and then ported to Linux and other
Unix variants.  If you're interested, you can still get it in source
code form right here.

only</a> (24K). This patch also includes some of the fixes in 2.1pl2.  It should be
applied to the original 2.1 sources; it will not apply correctly to
2.1pl2 or pl3.
