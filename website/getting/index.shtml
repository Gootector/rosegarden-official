    <h2>How to get Rosegarden</h2>

    <p>The Rosegarden development team currently only makes Rosegarden
    available in source code form to be compiled after download.</p>

    <h2>New! Fervent Software's Studio to Go!</h2>

    <p><b>Studio..<i>to
    go!</i></b> is a commercial package of music software on a
    single bootable Live CD, with support.  Rosegarden is included,
    along with a wide selection of other software all configured and
    ready to go.  This is almost certainly the easiest way to get a
    complete Rosegarden configuration, particularly if you aren't a
    Linux user already.  <a
    href="http://www.ferventsoftware.com/">Find out more here!</a></p>

    <h2>Downloads</h2>

	<p><i>Note: please read the <a
	href="/getting/requirements/">Hardware and System Requirements
	page</a> to find out whether Rosegarden will work on your
	system.</i></p>

    <h3>Source code</h3>

    <ul><li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/"><img align="right"
src="http://sourceforge.net/sflogo.php?group_id=4932&type=1"
width="88" height="31" border="0" alt="SourceForge.net Logo"/></a><a
href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=4932&release_id=290255">Rosegarden
release 1.0pre1 sources</a>, 16th December 2004, for download from the
SourceForge page.</li>

	    <li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=4932">Rosegarden
CVS</a> from the SourceForge repository; this is the latest
bleeding-edge, work-in-progress and might not build or run but will
have all the latest features as discussed on the rosegarden-devel
mailing list.</li></ul>

    <h3>Binary packages</h3>

    <p>These are all maintained by other people, so it may take a
    short while before they are brought up-to-date with each new
    release of Rosegarden and there's no guarantee of their
    completeness.  Please take a moment to check whether you are
    really getting the latest release (currently Rosegarden-4-1.0pre1,
    also known as Rosegarden-4-0.9.91) before you download a binary
    package.</p>

<h3>Rosegarden for Mandrake</h3>

<ul><li><a
href="http://rpm.nyvalls.se/">Rosegarden for Mandrake</a>, one of Thac's amazing list of audio and music application RPMs -- click through according to your version of Mandrake and scroll down to find Rosegarden.</li>
</ul>

<p>Apparently there's also an RPM in the Mandrake Cooker bleeding-edge
package repository.</p>

<h3>Rosegarden for SuSE</h3>

<p>We don't know of any source of up-to-date SuSE packages of
Rosegarden.  SuSE have included Rosegarden in their last two
distributions, but neither of the packages worked very well.

<p>We recommend building from source on SuSE: two of the three core
Rosegarden developers use SuSE and you should be able to compile
Rosegarden out of the box on SuSE 8.2 or 9.0.

<h3>Rosegarden for RedHat</h3>

<ul><li><a href="http://www-ccrma.stanford.edu/planetccrma/software/soundapps.html#rosegarden">Rosegarden for RedHat 7.3, 8.0, 9.0, and Fedora Core 1</a> from
<a href="http://www-ccrma.stanford.edu/planetccrma/software/">Planet CCRMA</a>.
<br><br>

Planet CCRMA is a well-maintained and easy to use distribution of
audio and sound applications for RedHat, which can install everything
you need semi-automatically.  If you want to set up an audio
workstation on RedHat, your best bet is to install the Planet CCRMA
system: read the documentation on the Planet site, and go from there.</ul>

<h3>Rosegarden for Debian</h3>

<ul><li>
Rosegarden is available as part of
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/sound/rosegarden4">Debian unstable</a>, thanks to Enrique Robledo Arnuncio.
</li></ul>

<h3>Rosegarden for your distribution</h3>

<p>Several distributions are now including versions of Rosegarden, if
not in the base distribution then in an extended package repository.
For example, Mandrake, SuSE, Debian and the Russian language ALT Linux
all make Rosegarden packages available to their users.</p>

<p>If we're not packaged as part of your favourite distribution then
please get in touch with your distribution manufacturer and ask why
not!  If you've made an RPM or package for any distribution then
please let us know so that we can link it here.</p>

<h3>"X11 Rosegarden" 2.1 releases</h3>

<p>Before the current Rosegarden project, there was another
Rosegarden: a now rather antique program, simpler, less powerful but
also less resource-hungry.  We're calling it "X11 Rosegarden" here, to
distinguish it from the newer Rosegarden.  It was originally written
for Silicon Graphics IRIX machines, and then ported to Linux and other
Unix variants.  If you're interested, you can still get it in source
code form right here.
