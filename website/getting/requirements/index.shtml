    <h2>Hardware and System Requirements</h2>

    <p>Rosegarden is a multi-purpose application whose hardware
    requirements differ markedly depending on what you're using it
    for.  Editing, playing and recording MIDI and editing score are
    less resource-hungry than recording or playing audio.  The use of
    multiple audio plugins or soft-synths will especially impact
    system performance.  </p>

    <h3>System hardware</h3>

	<p>As this is a Linux application, the first requirement is
	for a PC capable of running Linux.  (It is possible to run
	Linux on Mac and some other systems, but we have no
	information about using Rosegarden in that environment.)

    <p>The recommended minimum hardware for MIDI use is a
    400MHz system with 64MB of memory.  With an 800MHz system with
    256MB of memory you should have enough power to sequence MIDI and
    audio with score editing and a small number of audio plugins.</p>

	<p>More serious audio use will require more power: in
	particular, it's absolutely vital to ensure you have enough
	memory to keep all necessary audio components (synths,
	plugins, Rosegarden sequencer process) in memory at once
	&ndash; currently 256MB is really a bare minimum, as Rosegarden
	is a fairly memory-hungry application.</p>

    <h3>Audio hardware</h3>

	<p>Rosegarden requires and uses the <a
	href="http://www.alsa-project.org/">ALSA</a> sound drivers to
	drive your soundcard.  The Rosegarden project itself has no
	control over whether a card is supported or not: it depends
	entirely on whether the card has ALSA support.  To find out
	whether your hardware will work with ALSA, look it up in the
	<a href="http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/">ALSA Soundcard
	Matrix</a>.

    <p>
    Of course, if you're using an external MIDI device (sound module
    or keyboard) you'll also need the appropriate leads and
    cables.</p>

	<p>For help setting up your home studio for easy audio and
	MIDI recording, consult <a href="http://www.linuxmusician.com/index.php?option=displaypage&Itemid=51&op=page">Bownie's DIY Guide to Recording</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Software</h3>

    <p>Rosegarden runs on Linux, so you'll certainly need that.</p>

    <p>For its user interface Rosegarden uses the KDE 3 libraries, so
    you will need <a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a> 3.x with <a
    href="http://www.trolltech.com/">Qt</a> 3. You don't actually need
    to use the KDE desktop, you just need the library packages
    installed on your system.</p>

    <p>Rosegarden requires the <a
    href="http://www.alsa-project.org">ALSA</a> sound drivers for
    audio and MIDI support, and you will need the <a
    href="http://jackit.sf.net/">JACK audio server</a> if you want to
    do audio sequencing, although it isn't necessary for MIDI.</p>

    </p>

    <h3>Building from source code</h3>
    
    <p>In order to build Rosegarden-4, you will need a Unix-like
    operating system (most obviously Linux), the gcc 3.x C++ compiler,
    <a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a> 3.x with <a
    href="http://www.trolltech.com/">Qt</a>3.  See the <a
    href="faq.html">FAQ</a> for solutions to a few build and
    installation problems.  You may also wish to build with <a
    href="http://www.alsa-project.org/">ALSA</a> 0.9 or better for
    sound, <a href="http://jackit.sourceforge.net">JACK</a> (Jack
    Audio Connection Kit) for audio, and <a
    href="http://www.ladspa.org">LADSPA</a> (Linux Audio Developer's
    Simple Plugin API), for audio plugins.</p>
