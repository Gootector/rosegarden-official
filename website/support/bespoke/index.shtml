    <h3>Development and installation work</h3>

    <p>A strength of software licensed under the GNU General Public License &ndash; such as Rosegarden and many other Linux audio applications &ndash; is the freedom for anyone to alter it to fit particular needs, without risking the support contract or invalidating the license.</p>

    <p>This freedom is particularly valuable for situations such as education or larger installations where no off-the-shelf package is likely to meet your needs perfectly, unless by also including an expensive set of extra features you don't want.
    </p>

    <p>Fervent Software can offer the skills of core Rosegarden developers to do custom work with Rosegarden and any other GNU licensed music software.  <a href="http://www.ferventsoftware.com/">Contact us for more information.</a></p>

    <h3>Do you offer development work?</h3>

    <p>While we are promoting Fervent Software here because of their close involvement with the Rosegarden project, in fact anyone anywhere is can legally offer services based on Rosegarden and any other GPL software.  If you do and you'd like your name here, just <a href="mailto:cannam@all-day-breakfast.com">contact us</a>.</p>
