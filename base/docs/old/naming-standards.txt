Naming
------

 * Class names, typedefs, enums and structs begin with a capital letter,
   e.g. RipeBanana

 * Method names and local variables begin with a lower-case,
   e.g. getRipeBanana(), doComplexCalculation(), dumpCore()

 * Data members begin with m_ plus lower-case, e.g. m_ripeBanana.  This
   is a Microsoft-ism, but it's the only one I use.  This conflicts with
   Guillaume's native style

 * Global variables, and functions that aren't class methods, begin with
   an upper-case

 * Read accessors all begin with "get", unless they return a boolean
   value in which case "is", and write accessors begin with "set".

 * Macros are all-caps with underscores

Style
-----

Classes are defined in the order:

	1. public methods

        2. protected methods

        3. private methods

        4. private data members

Constructors and destructor go at the start of whichever
section they're in
