/**
 * Abstract base for classes that provide mappings from display
 * coordinates onto staffs and the elements on those staffs (and vice
 * versa).
 *
 * Where the LayoutEngine implementations determine the positions of
 * elements on staffs, the implementation of StaffLayout is likely to
 * determine the positions of staffs on a canvas (although one could
 * equally implement this class by simply delegating to other classes
 * that know better, and it's likely that some methods will ultimately
 * delegate to the implementation of Staff itself).
 * 
 * Any parameters called "x" or "y" are canvas coordinates.  They
 * correspond directly to the positions of events or canvas items on
 * the canvas.
 * 
 * We have to be fairly strict about this API, because it has to work
 * for many possibly layouts of staffs and so some methods need to be
 * given more inputs than would be expected of a simple linear layout.
 * (For example, getYOfHeightAtTime needs the time parameter in order
 * to cope with page-layout staffs that may be divided vertically as
 * well as horizontally.)
