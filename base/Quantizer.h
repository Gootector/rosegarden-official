/**

   The Quantizer class rounds the starting times and durations of note
   and rest events according to one of a set of possible criteria.
   These criteria are:

   -- "Unit quantization": For note events, starting time and duration
   are rounded to the nearest multiple of a given unit duration (by
   default, the duration of the shortest available note).  Rests are
   quantized in the same way, except where preceded by a note that has
   been lengthened by quantization, in which case the rest is
   shortened correspondingly before rounding.  This is the simplest
   sort of quantization.

   -- "Note quantization": Starting time is quantized as in unit
   quantization, but duration is first quantized by unit and then
   rounded to the nearest available note duration with a maximum of a
   given number of dots.

   -- "Legato quantization": As for note quantization, except that the
   given unit (for the initial unit-quantization step) is only taken
   into account if examining a note event whose duration will be
   caused to increase and that is followed by enough rest space to
   permit that increase.  Otherwise, the minimum unit is used.  It is
   therefore normal to perform legato quantization with larger units
   than the other kinds.

   [For example, say you have an event with duration 178.  A unit
   quantizer with a demisemi unit (duration 12) will quantize this to
   duration 180 (the nearest value divisible by 12).  But 180 is not a
   good note duration: a note quantizer would instead quantize to 192
   (the nearest note duration: a minim).]

   The results of the quantization are stored in separate properties
   in each event; quantization is not destructive of the event's
   intrinsic absolute time and duration.

   Note that although the quantizer may give rest events a duration of
   zero, it will never do so to note events.

   For best results, always quantize a whole segment or section of segment
   at once.  The quantizer can only do the right thing for rest events
   if given a whole section to consider at once.
