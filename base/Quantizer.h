     * Construct a quantizer programmed to do a single sort of
     * quantization.
     *
     * \arg source, target : Description of where to find the
     * times to be quantized, and where to put the quantized results.
     * 
     * These may be strings, specifying a prefix for the names
     * of properties to contain the timings, or may be the special
     * value RawEventData in which case the event's absolute time
     * and duration will be used instead of properties.
     * 
     * If source specifies a property prefix for properties that are
     * found not to exist, they will be pre-filled from the original
     * timings in the target values before being quantized and then
     * set back into the target.  (This permits a quantizer to write
     * directly into the Event's absolute time and duration without
     * losing the original values, because they are backed up
     * automatically into the source properties.)
     * 
     * Note that because it's impossible to modify the duration or
     * absolute time of an event after construction, if target is
     * RawEventData the quantizer must re-construct each event in
     * order to adjust its timings.  This operation (deliberately)
     * loses any non-persistent properties in the events.  This
     * does not happen if target is a property prefix.
     *
     *   Examples:
     *
     *   -- if source == RawEventData and target == "MyPrefix",
     *   values will be read from the event's absolute time and
     *   duration, quantized, and written into MyPrefixAbsoluteTime
     *   and MyPrefixDuration properties on the event.  A call to
     *   unquantize will simply delete these properties.
     *
     *   -- if source == "MyPrefix" and target == RawEventData,
     *   the MyPrefixAbsoluteTime and MyPrefixDuration will be
     *   populated if necessary from the event's absolute time and
     *   duration, and then quantized and written back into the
     *   event's values.  A call to unquantize will write the
     *   MyPrefix-property timings back into the event's values,
     *   and delete the MyPrefix properties.
     *
     *   -- if source == "YourPrefix" and target == "MyPrefix",
     *   values will be read from YourPrefixAbsoluteTime and
     *   YourPrefixDuration, quantized, and written into the
     *   MyPrefix-properties.  This may be useful for piggybacking
     *   onto another quantizer's output.
     *
     * \arg type : Type of quantization to carry out, as follows:
     *
     *   "UnitQuantize": For note events, starting time and duration
     *   are rounded to the nearest multiple of a given unit duration
     *   (by default, the duration of the shortest available note).
     *   Rests are quantized in the same way, except where preceded by
     *   a note that has been lengthened by quantization, in which
     *   case the rest is shortened correspondingly before rounding.
     *   This is the simplest sort of quantization.
     * 
     *   "Note": Starting time is quantized as in unit quantization,
     *   but duration is first quantized by unit and then rounded to
     *   the nearest available note duration with a maximum of a given
     *   number of dots.
     * 
     *   "Legato": As for note quantization, except that the given
     *   unit (for the initial unit-quantization step) is only taken
     *   into account if examining a note event whose duration will be
     *   caused to increase and that is followed by enough rest space
     *   to permit that increase.  Otherwise, the minimum unit is
     *   used.  It is therefore normal to perform legato quantization
     *   with larger units than the other kinds.
     *
     *   [For example, say you have an event with duration 178.  A
     *   unit quantizer with a demisemi unit (duration 12) will
     *   quantize this to duration 180 (the nearest value divisible by
     *   12).  But 180 is not a good note duration: a note quantizer
     *   would instead quantize to 192 (the nearest note duration: a
     *   minim).]
     *
     * \arg unit : Quantization unit.  Default is the shortest note
     * duration.
     *
     * \arg maxDots : how many dots to allow on a note before
     * declaring it not a valid note type.  Only of interest for
     * note or legato quantization.
     *
     * Note that although the quantizer may give rest events a
     * duration of zero, it will never do so to note events -- you
     * can't make a note disappear completely by quantizing it.
     *
     * For best results, always quantize a whole segment or section
     * of segment at once.  The quantizer can only do the right thing
     * for rest events if given a whole section to consider at once.
     *
     * The configuration of a Quantizer can't be changed after
     * construction.  Instead, construct a new one and assign it
     * if necessary.  (Construction and assignment are cheap.)
