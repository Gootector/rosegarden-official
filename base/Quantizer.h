    /** The quantizer can do two sorts of quantization: unit and note.
        Unit quantization is the usual sort a sequencer will expect;
        each event has its duration rounded to an integral multiple of
        a given unit duration.  Note quantization instead rounds each
        event to the closest duration expressible as a single note
        with a maximum number of dots.

        For example, say you have an event with duration 110.  A unit
        quantizer with a hemidemisemi unit (duration 6) will quantize
        this to duration 108 (the nearest value divisible by 6).  But
        108 is not a good note duration: a note quantizer would
        quantize to 96 (the nearest note duration: a crotchet).

        If you request note quantization, it does unit quantization as
        well -- the results are stored in separate properties and do
        not conflict.
