/**
 * Track is the container for a set of Events that are all played on
 * the same instrument.  Each event has an absolute starting time,
 * which is used as the index within the track.  Multiple events may
 * have the same absolute time.
 * 
 * (For example, chords are represented simply as a sequence of notes
 * that share a starting time.  The Track can contain counterpoint --
 * notes that overlap, rather than starting and ending together -- but
 * in practice it's probably too hard to display so we should make
 * more than one Track if we want to represent true counterpoint.)
 *
 * The Track is capable of doing various operations including
 * inserting and removing Events, splitting notes and rests,
 * calculating bar positions, etc.  It is aware of Note, Rest and
 * TimeSignature events and of BeamedGroup properties, but has no
 * awareness of any other specifically notation-related events
 * such as Key or Clef.
 *
 * The Track owns the Events its items are pointing at.
