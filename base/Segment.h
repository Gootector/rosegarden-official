/**
 * Segment is the container for a set of Events that are all played on
 * the same instrument.  Each event has an absolute starting time,
 * which is used as the index within the segment.  Multiple events may
 * have the same absolute time.
 * 
 * (For example, chords are represented simply as a sequence of notes
 * that share a starting time.  The Segment can contain counterpoint --
 * notes that overlap, rather than starting and ending together -- but
 * in practice it's probably too hard to display so we should make
 * more than one Segment if we want to represent true counterpoint.)
 *
 * If you want to carry out notation-related editing operations on
 * a Segment, take a look at SegmentNotationHelper.  If you want to play a
 * Segment, try SegmentPerformanceHelper for duration calculations.
 *
 * The Segment owns the Events its items are pointing at.
