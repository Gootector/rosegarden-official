/** LockableBase implements a lock timer.  It doesn't implement any
    locking semantics itself, that's up to the subclass

    Timeouts are in milliseconds.  The defaults are quite aggressive,
    but a client will only lose a lock if the timeout expires *and*
    another client requests the lock; a Lockable won't go out of its
    way to reap stale locks.  So on something like an Element that's
    generally acquired, used and abandoned, the default might be okay.
    
    A Lockable with negative timeout will never time out.  (A Lockable
    with zero timeout will always time out.)

    many times as locked.  This is overkill if you only want a pure

    In the Rosegarden server, this was intended for use with the Part
    -- each iterator created would lock the Part and then unlock when
    released; the Part could not be deleted with extant locks.  The
    transaction code made this obsolete, because a Part could not be
    deleted when an iterator was in use for a transaction anyway.
    (Read-only clients need to check isOK() on their iterators
    constantly, but that's better than a r/w client being wholly
    unable to delete a Part because a r/o client is performing it.)

    clients attempting to carry out an operation when another
    transaction is going on) reduced.

    TransactionLockable and every mutating operation has to show a
    valid transaction id.  (database/impl/Transaction.[Ch] wrap this
    class; they also admit the possibility of null id for clients that
