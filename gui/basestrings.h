/**

 * 
 * This file contains strings from base/ that need to be
 * translated; eventually it should be deprecated in favor
 * of a more robust solution.
 * 
 *  Why is this not robust?  As it currently stands, you must update 
 *  strings in at least two places (here and base/) every time something
 *  changes.  Getting it wrong only affects translation, though, which
 *  is arguably not too awful.
