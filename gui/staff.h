 * lines, as well as basic positional and size data.

 * Staff owns the ViewElementsManager and NotationElementList objects
 * it contains, but not the Track object it's constructed from.

 * Despite appearances, there's very little in here that's notation-
 * specific.  Probably we should have a base class without the
 * notation stuff, because LayoutEngine refers to Staff and
 * LayoutEngine is supposed to be an abstract base independent of the
