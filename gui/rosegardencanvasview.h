/**
 * A pseudo GC in which CanvasItems whose ownership isn't clear cut
 * can be put for periodical removal.
 *
 * This is especially for SegmentItems which can put their repeat
 * rectangles when they're being deleted.
 *
 * The problem this solves is a classic ownership/double deletion
 * case. The SegmentCanvas deletes all its items on destruction. But
 * the SegmentItems have an auxiliary "repeat rectangle" which is a
 * QCanvasRectangle, that needs to be deleted when the SegmentItem is
 * itself deleted.
 *
 * However, if the SegmentItem deletes its repeat rectangle, then when
 * the SegmentCanvas destruction occurs, the SegmentCanvas dtor will
 * get a list of all its children (QCanvas::allItems()), containing
 * both SegmentItems and their repeat rectangles. Deleting a
 * SegmentItem will delete its repeat rectangle, which will still be
 * present in the all children list which the SegmentCanvas dtor is
 * iterating over.
 * 
 * So a solution is simply to push to-be-deleted repeat rectangles on
 * this GC, which should be processed on canvas updates, for instance.
