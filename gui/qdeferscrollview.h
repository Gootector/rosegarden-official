/**
 * A QScrollView which defers vertical scrolling (through mouse wheel)
 * elsewhere, typically another QScrollView, so that both can be kept
 * in sync. The master scrollview will connect its vertical scrollbar
 * to the slave view so the scrollbar will act on both views.
 *
 * The slave scrollview will defer its scrolling to the master by
 * having the gotWheelEvent() signal connected to a slot in the master
 * scrollview, which will simply process the wheel event as if it had
 * received it itself.
