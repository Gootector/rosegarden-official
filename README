SPECIAL NOTES FOR PACKAGE MAINTAINERS
-------------------------------------

As of 09.10 all formerly optional dependencies are now mandatory dependencies.
We've taken this step because it is a real support hassle working through a set
of problems to finally uncover the reason something has broken is due to the
user's distro package being built without a particular feature turned on.

Most major distros already carry everything we depend on, so we don't anticipate
this will be a serious annoyance for package maintainers.

Thank you for your cooperation, and thank you for making Rosegarden available to
our users!
