Rosegarden-4 v0.9.5
===================

Rosegarden-4 is a MIDI and audio sequencer and musical notation editor.

This is an beta release, containing nearly all of the features
expected for 1.0 but without all of the correctness and stability.

Please keep an eye on the FAQ for known problems and workarounds:

  http://www.all-day-breakfast.com/rosegarden/faq.html

When you find bugs, first check whether a newer version of Rosegarden
has been released yet; if not, please check whether your bug has
already been reported on the bug tracker:

  http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=4932&atid=104932

and if it hasn't, please report it there!


Build requirements
------------------

The big requirement is KDE 3.x, or more specifically the KDE 3.x
development libraries (you don't need the whole KDE environment).

Our code compiles with gcc-3.x.

For MIDI support on Linux, you need ALSA 0.9.x or 1.0; for audio you
also need JACK 0.77 or newer.


Compiling from source
---------------------

If you obtained the source code from the SourceForge CVS repository:

  grab one of the developers' configure scripts such as
  "gl_configure", edit it to your needs (you will most likely first
  need to change the Qt and KDE install paths in the script according
  to your setup), and run it. It will setup your source tree so you'll
  just have to run "make" afterwards.

  For more info, you can refer to the "COMPILING" file found in the
  KDE source code for a description of how to compile code from CVS,
  but the xx_configure scripts should perform the actions described in
  that file for you (make -f Makefile.cvs ; ./configure...).

  After configuring, run "make" and, if the compile succeeds, "make
  install".  (The pixmaps need to be installed to the global KDE
  directories before the application will run correctly.)


If you obtained the source code from a distribution tarball: 

  Just run 

    ./configure

  plus appropriate "--with-qt-dir=..." and "--prefix=..." options.
  Then proceed with "make" and "make install".


NOTE: The installation prefix should be the same as the one of your
KDE installation. However you can install to another directory, but
then you'll have to append it to your KDEDIRS variable. For instance :

KDEDIRS=/usr:/home/glaurent/rosegarden


Running Rosegarden
------------------

Just run the "rosegarden" application (found in the KDE bin directory
after installation, and also in the gui/ directory of the source
tree).  The sequencer process is started automatically when the gui is
started, provided it has been correctly installed (by "make install")
in the global KDE directories.  If you have any problems running the
application, consult the FAQ:

  http://www.all-day-breakfast.com/rosegarden

or if that doesn't answer your question then use the rosegarden-user
mailing list on Sourceforge.

You can also "make uninstall" if you decide it's a waste of your time.


About scalable notation fonts
-----------------------------

Rosegarden-4 now supports scalable fonts for rendering notation as
well as the "built-in" pixmap shapes.  Using scalable fonts can
provide you with better-quality display in more different sizes on
screen, but the main advantage is significantly improved print
quality.  To use this feature, your Linux installation must have font
support based on Xft-2.1.0 and fontconfig.

A copy of the Lilypond feta.ttf font is included in the distribution
(but not installed by default).  If you want to use it, you need to
install it in your system in the same way as any other TrueType font;
consult your Linux distribution documentation for details.  Once
installed, Rosegarden-4 should find it automatically on startup and
make it available in the notation font menu under the name "Feta
scalable".  (The font called "Feta" is always the non-scalable
built-in pixmap font.)

Rosegarden also includes font mapping files which allow it to
recognise and use some other common fonts, if they are installed:
currently Adobe Sonata (which costs money, but looks quite nice);
Xinfonia (a free but incomplete font from xemo.org); Maestro/Petrucci
(the fonts supplied with Finale -- the Finale licence may not permit
using those fonts with other applications, but there are other more
permissively licenced fonts that are compatible with them that can be
used, such as Fughetta); Opus/Inkpen (the fonts used by Sibelius --
again, it is probably not legitimate to use those actual fonts, but
there may be others with compatible encodings); and Steinberg Notation
(used by Cubase, and the same caveats probably apply).  Most of these
mappings are rather experimental: some glyphs may be missing and the
sizes and positions may look rather odd.


Notes for developers
--------------------

We are actively seeking developers who are interested in coding new
parts of the application, adding features, and fixing bugs.  See
the files in docs/task_lists/ for some idea of the things
we're already thinking about doing for the next developer release.
Good ideas are also welcome.

Be warned that we intend to be fairly strict about code quality... as
far as that's possible, given the not always superb standards of our
own code.


Documentation
-------------

All the documentation we have is in the docs/ subdirectory.  Good
starting-points include:

  docs/howtos/alsa-notes -- brief notes about getting and installing the
	ALSA sound drivers (we recommend ALSA for use with Rosegarden)
  docs/howtos/artsd-mcop-notes.txt -- notes on how to get sound with aRts
	(not recommended!)

  docs/code/global_design.txt -- which classes do what, more or less
  docs/data_struct/units.txt -- how we store pitch and time
  docs/data_struct/sets.txt -- some terminology explained

  docs/task_lists/tasks_available.txt and
  docs/task_lists/1.0_release.txt -- ideas for what to do next (see also
  the SourceForge tracker page for feature requests and bug reports)
