Rosegarden v1.6.0-svn
=====================

Rosegarden is a MIDI and audio sequencer and musical notation editor.

Please keep an eye on the FAQ for known problems and workarounds:

  http://rosegarden.wiki.sourceforge.net/Frequently+Asked+Questions

When you find bugs, first check whether a newer version of Rosegarden
has been released yet; if not, please continue on to:

Build requirements
------------------

The big requirement is KDE 3.3, or later, or more specifically the KDE
3.3+ development libraries (you don't need the whole KDE environment).

Our code compiles with gcc-3.x and gcc-4.x.

For MIDI support on Linux, you need ALSA 0.9.x or 1.0; for audio you
need JACK 0.77 or newer; for synth plugins you need DSSI 0.9.x or
newer; for synth plugin GUI support you need liblo 0.7 or newer.

We have recently switched to CMake for building (having previously
started out with autotools and then switched to scons -- sorry!).
Please read the INSTALL file for details of how to build and install
Rosegarden using CMake.


Running Rosegarden
------------------

Just run the "rosegarden" application (found in the KDE bin directory
after installation).  The sequencer process is started automatically
when the gui is started, provided it has been correctly installed (by
"make install") in the global KDE directories.

If you have any problems running the application, review the
instructions in the INSTALL file and consult the FAQ:

  http://rosegarden.wiki.sourceforge.net/Frequently+Asked+Questions

If that doesn't answer your question, use the rosegarden-user mailing
list on SourceForge.


User documentation
------------------

There is a lot of documentation for Rosegarden available through the
Help menu.  Go to Help -> Rosegarden Handbook for the reference
manual, and Help -> Online Tutorial for a tutorial.


SPECIAL NOTES FOR PACKAGE MAINTAINERS
-------------------------------------

DSSI

Many distros released their packages of Rosegarden v1.0 compiled
without the optional DSSI/synth plugin support.  We received a lot of
complaints on our lists from your users and ours about your packages
being built without this feature.

We would like to request that you please take whatever steps are
necessary within the framework of your particular distro to ensure
that Rosegarden is built with DSSI support, and ideally that some of
the currently available DSSI plugins are also packaged for your
distro.  Thank you.  For details on DSSI, see:

  http://dssi.sourceforge.net/


Notes for developers
--------------------

We are actively seeking developers who are interested in coding new
parts of the application, adding features, and fixing bugs.  See the
bug and feature request trackers at SourceForge for inspiration.  If
you intend to do anything, please discuss it on the rosegarden-devel
mailing list (of course, providing working code will make your
argument extra persuasive).

Be warned that we tend to be fairly strict about code quality... as
far as that's possible, given the not always superb standards of our
own code.


Developer documentation
-----------------------

All the documentation we have (not enough) is in the docs/
subdirectory, including:

  docs/code/global_design.txt -- which classes do what, more or less
  docs/data_struct/units.txt -- how we store pitch and time
  docs/data_struct/sets.txt -- some terminology explained

  docs/howtos/alsa-notes -- brief notes about getting and installing the
	ALSA sound drivers (we recommend ALSA for use with Rosegarden)
  docs/howtos/artsd-mcop-notes.txt -- notes on how to get sound with aRts
	(not recommended!)
