The new build system has some targets that are only used for maintenance during
development work, and aren't of any interest to end users or casual followers of
the development line of code.

MAKE TARGET       FUNCTION
-----------       --------

ts                Update translation files.  Run before editing one of the .ts
                  files so that is is up to date before you begin work.  Run
                  after a string freeze when making a call to translators to
                  begin work in preparation for a release.  (Runs menu-ts
                  instruments-ts and autoload-ts automatically to extract
                  strings from autoload.rg, the menus, and presets.xml for
                  translation)

ts-noobsolete     Update translations and drop obsolete translations.  Run to
                  clean up any old translations after making big string changes in
                  the course of development.  (Probably a good idea to run this
                  before a call to translators.)

locale            Release all translations.  Run after editing any of the .ts
                  files or applying a patch from a translator.  Be sure to run
                  this before doing a release, because the .ts files don't get
                  used directly.  They have to be converted into .qm files first
                  by this make target!  (Apparently.  The docs seem to make me
                  think otherwise, but my translations didn't work until I made
                  .qm files)

qrc               Rebuild data/data.qrc to include all .pfa .png .qm .qss .rc
                  .rg .rgd .xml .xpm files under the data/ directory that have
                  been added to the Subversion repository.  Warns you if any
                  files exist which have not been added to the respository, and
                  does not add these files.  (Files must be added before they
                  can be built into the resource bundle so as to make it
                  difficult to commit a version of data.qrc that refers to files
                  that only exist in the developer's local working copy, which
                  breaks the repository for everyone else.)

tarball           Prepare a tarball for release, stripping out unwanted
                  development files, and giving the tarball an appropriate name.
                  NOTE: this hasn't actually been ported to the new build system
                  yet!! (should make the tarball target do locale first)
