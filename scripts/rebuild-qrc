# PURPOSE: Having to edit data.qrc by hand every time I add a file is annoying,
# and so I decided to write a script to assemble a .qrc file for me.  I'm
# surprised there wasn't one already.
#
# After some iterations, this script now refuses to add files that aren't under
# version control, so we can't (easily) commit a data.qrc that refers to
# local-only files.

WARNING! The following files are not under version control, and were ignored.
They must be added to the Subversion repository in order to be compiled into the
resource bundle.

In order to test new data files within the resource bundle, you must first svn
add them to your local working copy.  This policy ensures that all files
referred to by data.qrc will exist in the repository, so that developers will be
discouraged from committing a data.qrc that refers to missing files.  This
causes the entire build to fail for everyone else.
