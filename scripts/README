Miscellaneous scripts in this directory:

*_configure - various scripts used by the developers at various times
to configure from CVS with particular options

working correctly I think

exited JACK processes

convert-feta-xpm.sh, make-xpm-transparent.pl - parts of the process of
creating pixmaps from Lilypond feta fonts, used for the feta-pixmaps
notation font -- of limited use

convert-muse-idf.pl - convert a MusE instrument definition file (.idf)
to a Rosegarden device description file (.rgd) -- output is likely to
need some massaging

definition (.ins) files to Rosegarden device description (.rgd) files.
See http://ponzo.net/Rosegarden/ .

mirror
