      <h2>How to get involved in Rosegarden Development</h2>

      <p>
	We sometimes receive offers for help, and we really like that
	because it's quite nice to see other people being interested
	in your work. However, for some reason it seems people don't
	always know how to become involved. This document attemps to
	help volunteers on that way. Some things in here might offend
	you or put you off. Don't be. We're just being pragmatic.
      </p>

      <h3>What should I not do ?</h3>

      <ul>

      <li>Emailing us asking for permission to help, or offering help,
      expecting us to guide you or point you to something to do.</li>

      <p>We simply don't have the time or skills to manage people whom
      we don't know. If you want to help, you'll have to be
      autonomous.</p>

      <li>Detailing your skills, or even worse, sending us a CV</li>

      <p>You're not applying for a job here. We're not going to turn
      <b>any</b> offer of help down. You wanna help ? Great, consider
      yourself hired. Now get off your butt and go to the next
      section.</p>

      <li>Send bright ideas of cool features</li>

      <p>The overwhelming probability is that, we won't
      care. Really. The reason is simply that there are already so
      many things to do before this can be considered a working and
      useable application than we'll be strongly resisting any "fancy
      stuff". If you want to code it though, then that's another
      matter (see below).</p>

    </ul>

      <p>To sum up, it's been our experience that <a
      href="http://www.alt.net/~lk/cathedral-bazaar.html">this
      description</a> of the volunteering process is quite
      true. Please take a look at it, it's a short but very worthwhile
      read. (<i>note: by "our experience" we don't just mean the last
      few months after releasing 0.1 - we've all been involved at
      various levels in free software projects for several years.</i>)
      </p>

      <h3>What should I do ?</h3>
	
      <p>Just one thing : <b>Send us patches</b>

      <p>It's a simple empiric rule : <b>the longer you talk about your
      contribution, the less likely it is to happen</b>.</p>

      <p> People who come up with a patch attached to their first mail
      almost always end up being regular or at least worthwhile
      contributors. On the opposite, in the last few months we've
      already had half a dozen of people who offered help, discussed
      on stuff, sometimes at great length, and finally just
      disappeared.</p>

      <p>So just go ahead, if you think there's something interesting
      to do on our code, do it. If you've found a bug and want to work
      on it, do so (in both cases, be sure to work on the CVS version,
      though).</p>

      <p>This has of course to be balanced by the estimated importance
      of your contribution. If you plan to start something really big,
      it's probably better to ask us first, because it will probably
      interfere with our own development plans. But if it's a neat,
      self-contained feature, then just go ahead. We'll certainly be
      glad to integrate it.</p>


      <h3>Where do I start ?</h3>

      <p>Subscribe to the <a
      href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/rosegarden-devel">rosegarden-devel-admin@</a>
      mailing list.<p>
      
      <p>As usual, documentation is too scarce, but there are some
      design documents in the <code>docs/<code> directory of the
      source tree. You can also browse some automatically-generated <a
      href="code_doc">code reference documentation</a>. If you're
      stuck somewhere or don't understand something, just ask on the
      mailing-list.</p>

      <h3>But I can't code...</h3>
	
      <p>If you're a good writer, you can start the user manual. If
      you're good at drawing, you can draw icons. If you have
      experience with other sequencers (Logic, Cubase, Cakewalk), you
      can guide us and answer some of our questions on which UI is
      best. If you're not any of this, well, it's better if you get
      some programming skills elsewhere and come back. Rosegarden's
      code is fairly complex, and not a good place to learn C++ or
      even Qt/KDE programming.</p>

      <p>What we don't need at the moment are, as surprising as it
      seems, testers. People just reporting bugs. We use the app often
      enough to notice bugs pretty quickly, and we know there are
      many. So reporting them without a correction attached is like
      stating the obvious. As said above, however, reporting <b>and
      correcting</b> them is extremely welcome.</p>
