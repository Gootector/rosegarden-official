      <h2>How to get involved in Rosegarden development</h2>

      <p>We're always looking for people willing to participate on the
      project. If you're interested, here are a few indications on how
      to start.</p>

      <h3>First steps</h3>

      <p>Subscribe to the <a
      href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/rosegarden-devel">rosegarden-devel</a>
      mailing list.<p>
      
      <p>As usual, documentation is too scarce, but there are some
      design documents in the <code>docs/</code> directory of the
      source tree. You can also browse some automatically-generated <a
      href="code_doc">code reference documentation</a>. We try to keep
      it up to date, but you can generate it youself with <a
      href="http://www.doxygen.org/">doxygen</a>, the Doxyfile is in CVS.

      <p>If you're stuck somewhere or don't understand something, just
      ask on the mailing-list.</p>

      <h3>What next ?</h3>

      <p>Pick something you're interested in doing. You'll have to do
      that yourself. As strange as it may sound we're not well placed
      to tell you what to do. First of all, we have no desire to do
      so, and experience shows that it simply doesn't work that
      way. People say "Ok, I'll try" and disappear, never to be heard
      of again :-). So if you're really interested in working with us,
      it's better if you choose your own job.</p>

      <p>If you want to see what we should be currently working on
      then have a look at our (probably not quite up to date) <a
      href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/rosegarden/docs/task_lists/">task
      lists</a>.</p>

      <p>Just remember that contributions of any kind are
      <b>always</b> welcome. You don't need to ask for permission. If
      the first thing you send to the list is a patch, we won't blame
      you for failing to introduce yourself properly, quite the
      contrary :-).</p>

      <p>If you're not too sure about what you intend to do (is it a
      good idea, are some people already working on this...), then ask
      on the list.

      <p>A bit of discussion before coding never hurts. If what you
      want to do involves non-trivial design, then it's probably
      better to ask for comments on the list as well.</p>


      <h3>But I can't code...</h3>
	
      <p>If you're a good writer, you can write some documentation. If
      you're good at drawing, you can draw icons. If you have
      experience with other sequencers (Logic, Cubase, Cakewalk), and
      especially if you're a musician, you can provide us with
      expertise on the matter, and answer some of our questions on
      which UI is best.

      <p>If you're not any of this, well, it's probably better if you
      get some programming skills elsewhere and come
      back. Rosegarden's code is fairly complex, and not a good place
      to learn C++ or even Qt/KDE programming. For these last two,
      look at the <a href="http://doc.trolltech.com">Qt
      documentation</a> and <a href="http://developer.kde.org">KDE
      Developer's Corner</a>.</p>


      <h3>A few things to avoid :-)</h3>

      <ul>
      <li>Sending <i>cool ideas</i> ("hey wouldn't it be cool if...")
      with no apparent willingness to implement them will be frowned
      upon. It's not that we don't want <i>cool ideas</i>, we
      <i>like</i> cool ideas, it's more that we need to get Rosegarden
      to a reasonable level of competency before we can implement
      them.  Have a search through the <a
      href="http://www.geocrawler.com/lists/3/SourceForge/16004/0/">development
      mailing list archives</a> to find out what we have talked about
      over the last few months and what <i>cool ideas</i> we've
      ignored or are thinking of doing later on.  If you think we're
      missing something (either in the head or in the code) then
      please don't be backward in coming forward.</li>

      <li>As a corollary to "pick something you're interested in
      doing", don't email us asking for permission to help, or
      offering help, expecting us to guide you or point you to
      something to do. If you want to help, you'll have to be
      a bit more autonomous and take initiatives :-).</li>

    </ul>

      <p>As a final note, we've always found <a
      href="http://www.alt.net/~lk/cathedral-bazaar.html">this
      description</a> of the volunteering process to be quite true.
      Please take a look at it, it's a short but very worthwhile read.
