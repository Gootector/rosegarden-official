      <h2>How to get involved in Rosegarden development</h2>

      <p>We sometimes receive offers for help, and we really like that
      because it's nice to see other people being interested in your
      work. However, for various reasons people don't always know how
      to become involved. This document attempts to help volunteers
      understand where to begin. Some things in here might offend you
      or put you off. Don't be. We're just being pragmatic.</p>

      <h3>Why do you hate me?</h3>
      <p>The core developers are currently (as of January 2002) in the
      middle of a coding blitz so please excuse them if your <i>cool
      idea</i> doesn't make much immediate impression.
      <br>
      <br>
      It's not that we don't want <i>cool ideas</i>, we <i>like</i>
      cool ideas, it's more that we need to get Rosegarden to a reasonable
      level of competency before we can implement them.  Have a search
      through the
      <a href="http://www.geocrawler.com/lists/3/SourceForge/16004/0/">development mailing list archives</a>
      to find out what we have talked about over the last few months
      and what <i>cool ideas</i> we've ignored or are thinking of
      doing later on.  If you think we're missing something (either
      in the head or in the code) then please don't be backward in
      coming forward.
      <br>
      <br>
      Remember we don't hate you and we don't hate your ideas.
      If you want to see what we should be currently working on then
      have a look at our (probably not quite up to date)
      <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/rosegarden/docs/task_lists/">task lists</a>.
      </p>

      <p>Ok, enough of the ego stroking - on with the rules.</p>
 



      <h3>What should I not do ?</h3>

      <ul>

      <li>Don't email us asking for permission to help, or offering help,
      expecting us to guide you or point you to something to do.</li>

      <p>We simply don't have the time or skills to manage people whom
      we don't know. If you want to help, you'll have to be
      autonomous.</p>

      <li>Don't detail your skills, or even worse, send us a CV</li>

      <p>You're not applying for a job here. We're not going to turn
      <b>any</b> offer of help down. You want to help ? Great, consider
      yourself hired. Now get off your butt and go to the next
      section.</p>

      <li>Don't send bright ideas of cool features</li>

      <p>The overwhelming probability is that, we won't
      care. Really. The reason is simply that there are already so
      many things to do before this can be considered a working and
      useable application than we'll be strongly resisting any "fancy
      stuff". If you want to code it though, then that's another
      matter (see below).</p>

    </ul>

      <p>We've always found <a
      href="http://www.alt.net/~lk/cathedral-bazaar.html">this
      description</a> of the volunteering process to be quite true.
      Please take a look at it, it's a short but very worthwhile read.

      <h3>What should I do ?</h3>
	
      <p>Just one thing : <b>Send us patches</b>

      <p>It's a simple empirical rule : <b>the longer you talk about your
      contribution, the less likely it is to happen</b>.</p>

      <p> People who come up with a patch attached to their first mail
      almost always end up being regular (or at least worthwhile)
      contributors.  On the other hand, in the last few months we've
      already had half a dozen people offer help, discuss stuff,
      sometimes at great length, and finally just disappear.</p>

      <p>So just go ahead, if you think there's something interesting
      you can do with our code, do it. If you've found a bug and want
      to work on it, do so (in both cases, be sure to work on the CVS
      version, though).</p>

      <p>This has of course to be balanced by the estimated importance
      of your contribution. If you plan to start something really big,
      it's probably better to ask us first, because it will probably
      interfere with our own development plans. But if it's a neat,
      self-contained feature, then just go ahead. We'll almost
      certainly be glad to integrate it.</p>


      <h3>Where do I start ?</h3>

      <p>Subscribe to the <a
      href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/rosegarden-devel">rosegarden-devel</a>
      mailing list.<p>
      
      <p>As usual, documentation is too scarce, but there are some
      design documents in the <code>docs/</code> directory of the
      source tree. You can also browse some automatically-generated <a
      href="code_doc">code reference documentation</a>. If you're
      stuck somewhere or don't understand something, just ask on the
      mailing-list.</p>

      <h3>But I can't code...</h3>
	
      <p>If you're a good writer, you can start the user manual. If
      you're good at drawing, you can draw icons. If you have
      experience with other sequencers (Logic, Cubase, Cakewalk), you
      can guide us and answer some of our questions on which UI is
      best. If you're not any of this, well, it's better if you get
      some programming skills elsewhere and come back. Rosegarden's
      code is fairly complex, and not a good place to learn C++ or
      even Qt/KDE programming.</p>

      <p>What we don't need at the moment are, as surprising as it
      seems, testers. People just reporting bugs. We use the app often
      enough to notice bugs pretty quickly, and we know there are
      many. So reporting them without a correction attached is like
      stating the obvious. As said above, however, reporting <b>and
      correcting</b> them is extremely welcome.</p>
