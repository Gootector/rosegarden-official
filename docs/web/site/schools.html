    <h3>Rosegarden for schools</h3>

    <p>
    As Rosegarden is free software (as in beer and as in speech) it is
    intended that it it should be available and accessible to the widest
    range of users as possible.  The Rosegarden team is more than happy
    to give demos to schools or any organisations with an interest in
    music production.  At the moment this service is limited to the areas
    in and surrounding London, UK but we're hoping to expand this service
    soon.  Please <a href="contact.html">get in touch with us</a> if you
    want to take advantage of this service or want to talk to us further
    about Rosegarden and making music under Linux.
    </p>

    <h3>Feature requests</h3>
    <p>
    As part of our ongoing open development process we're usually able to
    react quickly to feature requests.  If your organisation has a special
    need or requirement for use or deployment of our software then please
    <a href="contact.html">contact us</a>.
