      <h3>What is Rosegarden?</h3>

      <p>Rosegarden is an integrated MIDI sequencer and musical
      notation editor.  It is free software for Unix and X, running on
      systems such as Linux, FreeBSD and SGI IRIX, and now also on
      OpenVMS.  Take a look at some <a
      href="pictures.html">pictures</a> of it in use.<p>

      <h3>Get the latest version</h3>
      
      <h4>Old-series Rosegarden</h4>
      
      <p>The current version, which you can <a
      href="download.html">download here</a>, is 2.1 patchlevel 3,
      released in October 2001.  Not very much has changed since
      version 2.1, which was released in October 1997; the 2.1 series
      is no longer in active development, and it's likely that there
      will continue only to be occasional patch releases.

      <p>For a list of features, including a list of changes for 2.1
      and previous releases, see the <a href="features.html">features
      page</a>.

      <h4>New-series Rosegarden</h4>

        <p>We also have a <a
        href="http://rosegarden.sourceforge.net/">development
        series</a>, which is a complete rewrite that is not yet
        suitable for real use but may be of interest to other
        developers.  (There have been a few developer
        releases, with release numbers less than 1, but when we
        finally release a user version it will be called Rosegarden
        4.)

	<p>All the available information about this new series is
        on SourceForge; the site you're reading now is only about the
        existing 2.1 version.

      <h4>What does it run on?</h4>

      <p>To run Rosegarden 2.1, you will need a computer that runs Unix or
      OpenVMS with the X window system.  If you have an Intel PC with
      Linux, or a Silicon Graphics IRIX machine, you can use one of
      the binary distributions; otherwise you'll have to compile it
      from the source distribution.  (This may be the best idea
      anyway, even if you do have Linux or IRIX.)  To compile it, you
      need a C compiler and the X libraries.

      <p><a href="http://www.4front-tech.com/"><img align="right"
      src="oss16.gif" vspace="6" hspace="6" height="115" width="83"
      alt=""></a> Of course, if you want to make some <em>noise</em>
      then you'll need a version of Unix with a sound driver that
      Rosegarden can use.  The standard Open Sound System Lite drivers
      for Linux or FreeBSD should be okay; the Silicon Graphics MIDI
      drivers built in to IRIX 5.2 onwards should also work.  For
      other platforms, you may be able to use commercial <A
      HREF="http://www.4front-tech.com/">Open Sound System</a>
      drivers.

      <p>Also, just because Rosegarden understands your sound driver
      doesn't mean it understands your sound<i>card</i>; external MIDI
      synthesisers are more likely to work than internal soundcard
      ones.<!--  For more information, see the <a
      href="faq.html">Frequently Asked Questions</a> page. -->

      <h4>Where do I get it?</h4>

      <p>You can <a href="download.html">download</a> source and
      binary distributions from this very site.
