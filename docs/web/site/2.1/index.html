      <h3>What is Rosegarden-2.1?</h3>

      <p><b>Rosegarden-2.1</b> is an integrated MIDI sequencer and musical
      notation editor.  It is free software for Unix and X, running on
      systems such as Linux, FreeBSD and SGI IRIX, and now also on
      OpenVMS.  Take a look at some <a
      href="pictures.html">pictures</a> of it in use.<p>

      <p>Rosegarden-2.1 is an old program that has not been
      significantly improved for over four years, apart from a few bug
      fixes and some very minor features.  All the new stuff is
      happening in the <a href="../index.html">Rosegarden-4
      project</a>, which is not yet ready for solid use but should be
      much more usable than Rosegarden-2.1 before very much longer.

      <h3>Get the latest release</h3>
      
      <p>The current version, which you can <a
      href="../download.html">download here</a>, is 2.1 patchlevel 4,
      released in April 2002.  Not very much has changed since
      version 2.1, which was released in October 1997; the 2.1 series
      is no longer in active development, and it's likely that there
      will continue only to be occasional patch releases.

      <p>For a list of features, including a list of changes for 2.1
      and previous releases, see the <a href="features.html">features
      page</a>.

      <h4>What does it run on?</h4>

      <p>To run Rosegarden-2.1, you will need a computer that runs Unix or
      OpenVMS with the X window system.  If you have an Intel PC with
      Linux, or a Silicon Graphics IRIX machine, you can use one of
      the binary distributions; otherwise you'll have to compile it
      from the source distribution.  (This may be the best idea
      anyway, even if you do have Linux or IRIX.)  To compile it, you
      need a C compiler and the X libraries.

      <p><a href="http://www.4front-tech.com/"><img align="right"
      src="../oss16.gif" vspace="6" hspace="6" height="115" width="83"
      alt=""></a> Of course, if you want to make some <em>noise</em>
      then you'll need a version of Unix with a sound driver that
      Rosegarden can use.  The standard Open Sound System Lite drivers
      for Linux or FreeBSD should be okay; the Silicon Graphics MIDI
      drivers built in to IRIX 5.2 onwards should also work.  For
      other platforms, you may be able to use commercial <A
      HREF="http://www.4front-tech.com/">Open Sound System</a>
      drivers.

      <p>Also, just because Rosegarden understands your sound driver
      doesn't mean it understands your sound<i>card</i>; external MIDI
      synthesisers are more likely to work than internal soundcard
      ones.<!--  For more information, see the <a
      href="faq.html">Frequently Asked Questions</a> page. -->

      <h4>Where do I get it?</h4>

      <p>You can <a href="../download.html">download</a> source and
      binary distributions from this very site.
