      <h3>How to get involved in Rosegarden development</h3>

      <p>We're always looking for people willing to participate in the
      project. If you're interested, here are a few clues about how to start.</p>

      <h4>First steps</h4>

      <p>Subscribe to the
      <a href="list.html">rosegarden-devel</a> mailing list.</p>
      
      <p>As with any software project, the documentation is a little thin
      on the ground but there are some design documents and howtos in the
      <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/rosegarden/docs/"><code>docs/</code></a> area of the source tree. You can also browse the
      <a href="http://rosegarden.sourceforge.net/code_doc">code reference documentation</a> which we try to
      keep up to date.  You can also generate it yourself with
      <a href="http://www.doxygen.org/">doxygen</a> and the Doxyfile in CVS.</p>

      <p>If you're stuck somewhere or don't understand something then
      please ask on the 
      <a href="list.html">mailing list</a>.</p>

      <h4>What next?</h4>

      <p>Pick something that you want to do.  Make it something you're
      interested in and think you can help with.  This is something you'll
      have to do for yourself, as we find being prescriptive with tasks just
      turns people off.  If you're really interested in working with us,
      it's best if you choose your own job and therefore find your own
      motivation.</p>

      <p>(But be practical.  All the time spent working on one thing
      is time that can't be spent working on another. If your goal is
      to make software that other people can use and enjoy, work on
      the things that will give you the best return in usability on
      your investment of time. Working on something concrete based on
      existing code is a better use of your time than trying to change
      large parts of the design to support something fantastic that
      you dream of doing one day.)

      <p>If you want to see what we're working on now then have a look
      at our
      <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/rosegarden/docs/task_lists/">task lists</a>.
      They might be a little out of date but they'll give you a rough
      idea of what we're up to at the moment.</p>

      <p>If you think your work might clash with someone else's then
      just ask.  A bit of discussion before coding never hurts and
      being <b>Sensitive New Age Guys</b> we are big believers in
      talking about things.  If what you're planning to do is
      non-trivial then it's probably better to discuss it a little
      first.

      <p>Still, contributions of any kind are <b>always</b> welcome.
      You don't need to ask for permission and if the first thing you send 
      to the list is a patch we won't be complaining.</p>

      <p>
      Did we mention the
      <a href="list.html">mailing list</a>?
      </p>

      <h4>But I can't code...</h4>
	
      <p>If you're a good technical writer and patient enough to work with
      lazy and pedantic developers then you can help with the documentation.
      If you're good at drawing you can draw icons.  If you have experience
      with other sequencers (Logic, Cubase, Cakewalk) or if you're a
      musician, music technician or producer you can give us the benefit of
      that experience.  We'll always need help refining the user interface
      and overall direction of our design.</p>

      <p>If you're just learning to code then Rosegarden probably isn't
      the best place to start.  Our design is fairly complex and you'll
      need a reasonable grip of C++ not to mention Qt/KDE programming to
      understand it.  Despite that we do try to make the code as clear and
      well commented as possible and if you have the C++ but not the Qt/KDE
      then have a look at the
      <a href="http://doc.trolltech.com">Qt documentation</a> and
      <a href="http://developer.kde.org">KDE Developer's Corner</a>.</p>


      <h4>I've got a great idea!</h4>

      <p>
      Sending <i>cool ideas</i> ("hey wouldn't it be cool if...")
      with no apparent willingness to implement them is usually met
      with a even cooler silence.</p>

      <p>
      It's not that we don't want <i>cool ideas</i>, we <i>like</i>
      cool ideas, but until Rosegarden is reasonably competent at
      the basics there's probably no way we'll be implementing them.
      The chances are also quite good that we've discussed something
      like them before so
      always have a search through the <a href="http://www.geocrawler.com/lists/3/SourceForge/16004/0/">mailing list archives</a> before
      airing your new idea.</p>

      <p>
      If you're disappointed at our cautious approach to new ideas then
      please don't see us as dour, humourless corporate drones.  We prefer
      to be thought of as embittered world-weary hackers with a
      work ethic built upon a realistic mantra - see the bottom of the 
      <a href="history.html">development history</a> for more details.
      </p>

      <h4>So, still here?</h4>

      <p>We've always found <a
      href="http://www.alt.net/~lk/cathedral-bazaar.html">this
      description</a> of the open-source volunteering process to be
      quite true.  It's a short but very worthwhile read so please
      take a look.
      </p>

      <p>
      If you still think you can help and you haven't been put off by
      much of what you're read here then please
      <a href="list.html">get in touch</a>.
      </p>
