    <h3>About the authors</h3>

    <p>Rosegarden-4 has three core developers, who between them are to
    blame for almost exactly 99% of the code currently in the
    application.  You can help to reduce this figure by <a
    href="development.html">contributing to the development effort
    yourself</a>.

    <h4><a href="http://www.all-day-breakfast.com/cannam/">Chris Cannam</a></h4>
    <p><img style="float:right; margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 12px; margin-right:0px; margin-bottom:8px" src="http://www.all-day-breakfast.com/rosegarden-author-pic.png" alt=" "/>Chris is an unemployed good-for-nothing, wasting his days while his girlfriend scrapes in enough money to keep their small baby in nappies and formula.  He lives in London.<p>He first started working on Rosegarden at the end of 1993.  It
    was then a university project for two students, devised by
    professor <a href="http://www.bath.ac.uk/~masjpf/">John Fitch</a>
    at the University of Bath, with <a
    href="http://www.all-day-breakfast.com/space/">Andy Green</a>
    working on the MIDI sequencer and Chris on the notation editor.
    They were the sole developers until late in 1995, some time after
    the barely-usable 1.0 release.  For Rosegarden-4, Chris is
    responsible for most of the notation rendering and some of the
    file and data code.  He also made this website.

    <h4><a href="http://www.bownie.com/people/bownie/">Richard Bown</a></h4>

    <p><img style="float:right; margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 12px; margin-right:0px; margin-bottom:8px" src="http://www.bownie.com/rosegarden-author-pic.png" alt=" "/>Richard is a software developer, musician and producer living in
    London.  He's been a Rosegarden developer since the end of 1995,
    when he was drafted in to take over the Unix sequencer.  He is
    responsible for almost all the MIDI, audio, sequencing and
    recording code in Rosegarden-4.

    <p>Richard recently took a serious amount of time out to better
    understand the practical side of music software and computer based
    music production in the home.  Results are one very bad album, one
    very good <a href="http://www.bownie.com/guide/">no-nonsense
    web-guide to home recording</a> and a much improved knowledge of
    the MIDI and audio concerns faced by the Rosegarden team.  He aims
    to eventually use Rosegarden for all future production work.

    <h4><a href="http://www.telegraph-road.org">Guillaume Laurent</a></h4>

    alt=" "/>Guillaume lives in Cannes, in the South of France. (Lucky
    Guillaume.) He's been using Linux since 1995, and first worked on
    Rosegarden in the summer of 1996, when he supplied a few hundred
    lines of new code in his first couple of emails.  Guillaume is
    responsible for getting the Rosegarden-4 project restarted, for
    creating the basic design and writing much of the GUI code and
    file and data framework, and for most of the project administration.

    <p>He has also helped maintain <a href="http://gtkmm.sourceforge.net/">Gtk--</a> for a while, and is
    involved in some parts of <a href="http://www.kde.org">KDE</a> here and there.  In his spare time,
    he works as a software engineer.
