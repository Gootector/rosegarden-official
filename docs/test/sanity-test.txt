Rosegarden Sanity Tests
=======================

Introduction
------------

These tests should be run by anyone who wants to prove the level of
Rosegarden functionality at a given release point.  These tests can
also be used a basis for ensuring that the team has fully documented
the application as we head through beta testing.

If anyone has taken the time to run these tests on the application
then it would greatly help the development team if they could return
their results along with the specification of their machine, the 
configuration of Rosegarden and the release number.  Fill in the
boxes below.

Bugs and feature requests should be first checked and then logged on
the Rosegarden Sourceforge page:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/rosegarden/

Preferred test system and most common deployment configuration is
with Rosegarden-4 built for ALSA with JACK (and optionally LADPSA
plugins).

Good luck!

1. Installation and File loading
--------------------------------

1.1 Installation directories

From a clean system (without Rosegarden-4 installed) apply your
RPM or install your built tarball or CVS extract.  Assuming that
you've got the "rosegarden" and "rosegardensequencer" exectubles
in your path you should be able to launch the application from the
command line by typing:

% rosegarden

The application should present a splash-screen which will inform
you of the steps that Rosegarden is taking to start itself.  When
the application appears it should have the relevant pixmaps in
place on the toolbars.

1.2 Help system
Try accessing the help from the application menu Help->Rosegarden Handbook.
This should pop-up the handbook and allow you to navigate the help system.
The introduction to the help system should point the user to the Rosegarden
homepage as well as the Rosegarden Tutorials page.


1.3 Loading an example .rg file

There is a set of example files that come with Rosegarden-4 as part
of the tarball or as extracted from CVS.  They can be found in the
rosegarden/gui/testfiles directory or alternatively here:

http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/rosegarden/gui/testfiles/

Fetch these testfiles and subdirectories if you don't already have
them.  Go to the menu option File->Open... and choose the file
"mandolin-sonatina.rg".

This file should load and present you with three tracks.

1.4 Loading an example audio .rg file

Load the test file "outofspace.rg" from the testfiles directory.
Open the Audio File Manager (Segments->Manage Audio Segments) and
you should seem some audio files in there.
