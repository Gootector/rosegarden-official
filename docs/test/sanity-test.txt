These tests should be run by anyone who wants to prove the level of
Rosegarden functionality at a given release point.  These tests can
also be used a basis for ensuring that the team has fully documented
the application as we head through beta testing.

If anyone has taken the time to run these tests on the application
then it would greatly help the development team if they could return
their results along with the specification of their machine, the 
configuration of Rosegarden and the release number.

Bugs and feature requests should be checked and logged on the
Rosegarden Sourceforge page:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/rosegarden/
