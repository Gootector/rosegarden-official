    <p>
      <b>UPDATE: You need Qt 2.2.0 to compile the current code.</b>
    </p>

    <p>These are not RPMs because I've had troubles with them
    (conflicts with KDE 1) and wanted to have everything installed in
    one directory (/opt/kde2) so uninstall would be a simple 'rm
    -rf'.

    <h2>Compilation</h2>

    <p>If you didn't go the rpm way, you first need to compile
    Qt. This is very easy, although a bit non-standard. According to
    the installation procedure, you need to untar Qt <i>where you want
    to install it</i> (in our case that would be /opt/kde2 - I suggest
    we all install things at the same place to avoid stupid setup
    problems :-). So you do that, and now you have a /opt/kde2/qt-2.2.0.

    <p>I also have a 'qt2' symlink in /opt/kde2, so as to make qt
    upgrades easier and avoid the dependency on the version number.

    <p>Installing qt is as follows :
    <ol><code>
      <li>cd /opt/kde2/qt2
      <li>export QTDIR=$PWD
      <li>./configure -gif -sm -system-zlib -system-libpng -system-jpeg
      <li>make
	</code>
    </ol>

    <p>Once this is done, Qt is installed. You can clean things up a
    little by doing a 'make clean' in the 'src', 'tutorial' and
    'examples' dirs. 'make clean' isn't quite as thorough as it
    should, it leaves the executables around. Just do

    <p><pre>find tutorial examples -type f -perm +a+x | xargs rm</pre>

    <p>You also need to add the following lines to your /etc/ld.so.conf :
    <pre>/opt/kde2/qt2/lib
/opt/kde2/lib
    </pre>

    <p>and to call the usual 'ldconfig'.

    <p>In case you do not have sufficient room in /opt to compile
    things there, you can compile elsewhere, then just create
    /opt/kde2/qt-2.1.1, and symlink (or copy) the 'doc', 'include' and
    'lib' directories in it. It should work just as good.

    <p>Next is kde-qt-addon. This one is regular './configure;
    make; make install" stuff, so cd to wherever you want to compile
    it, and untar it there. Before running configure, just make sure
    you still have QTDIR pointing to the right place (/opt/kde2/qt2).

    <p>To install in /opt/kde2, run <code>./configure --prefix=/opt/kde2</code>.

    <p>Finally, install kdelibs. It's exactly the same
    (<code>./configure --prefix=/opt/kde2; make</code> yada yada
    yada).
