Introduction
------------

This mini-howto explains how to create a device definition file (in
Rosegarden speak). Please refer to the Rosegarden tutorial paying
particular attention to sections 2.4 to 2.10:

The Beginner Section
--------------------

Step One: Create The Voice List
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to create the *.rgd (device definition file) you need first to
know what voices are available for your MIDI device, i.e. what instruments
your keyboard or sound card can play.

The best source is probably your manual. Alternatively you may want to
search on the Internet.

Voices are organized in banks. Within banks each voice is specified by
a MIDI program change number. Banks are designated by using two numbers:
MSB (Most Significant Byte) and LSB (Least Significant Byte).

The MSB and LSB may take each any value between 0 and 127 (thus giving a
total of 16384 banks). The program number takes values from 0 to 127 in
the .rgd file but these will appear as 1 to 128 when viewed in your
manual and also when they are loaded into Rosegarden's Bank editor.

The bank with MSB=0 and LSB=0 is well defined and known as GM (General Midi).
The first voice in this bank is the "Acoustic/Grand Piano", i.e. pianoforte
and all 128 voices are well defined.

So we will tell Rosegarden about this voice somewhat like:

  * At MSB=0, LSB=0, Program=0 you find "Acoustic/Grand Piano"

The MIDI devices and software cares only about numbers, the name is for
human consumption. I.e. you will use "Acoustic/Grand Piano" and the
computer will understand "MSB=0, LSB=0, Program=0"

Rosegarden stores this information in the *.rgd file.

There are several ways you can tell Rosegarden what voices are available:

 1. Use Rosegarden itself, via the Studio -> Manage MIDI Devices menu
    However consider that only the GM bank contains already 128 voices
    and most keyboards or sound cards may well contain in excess of 500
    voices. So entering by hand is a very tedious process.

 2. Edit the *.rgd file directly: possible but not for the beginner
    (more about that below)

 3. Create a list of voices and then convert it to the *.rgd format

We will take here the third approach.

First create a file containing the list of all voices. You can use either
any text editor you feel comfortable with  or any spreadsheet able to export
in CSV (Comma Separated Values) format (any spreadsheet should be able to
do this).

The format of the file is very simple:

 a. Each line contains 5 parameters. Each parameter is separated from the
    next by either whitespace (spaces, tabs) and/or commas (only one comma
    between fields);

 b. Empty lines are ignored;

 c. You can add comments in any (reasonable) place. Comments start with
    the "#" character and continue to the end of line.

The list of the parameters is as follows:

 1. The first one is for your reference, it will be ignored in the final
    output. You can put whatever you like except whitespaces and commas
    (because they are separators) and "#" because it will be taken as a
    comment. An example of what you can put in here is the voice number,
    in order to keep track of what you have entered;

 2. The second one is the MSB, it is a integer between 0 and 127;

 3. The third one is the LSB, it is a integer between 0 and 127;

 4. The fourth one is the program change number, it is an integer between
    0 and 127 (remember, this is displayed as 1 to 128 in Rosegarden and
    in your manual);

 5. And finally the last one is the voice name. This field in particular
    may contain whitespace and/or commas but not "#";

You can optionally add comments after the fifth parameter.

Example:

    # This is a comment
       # This is another comment

    # GM Bank:
    first 0 0 1 Grand Piano   # this is the first voice from the GM bank
    2 ,   0 0, 2 Bright Piano

If you want to save yourself some time and make sure that the data entered is
correct you may proceed as follows:

 * First obtain the manual in pdf format (it is available for the
   Yamaha keyboards from their site, other manufacturers may have it;
   check your CDs as well)

 * Then try to see if you can copy & paste. You can do it from xpdf if the
   pdf allows it (sadly the Yamaha manuals don't!). Save the pastings
   into a text file.

 * If you can't then you are down to a qute tedious process: use ps2ascii
   to convert to text.

 * Finally edit the text to transform it into a format as described above.

It is still a tedious process but maybe less so than entering all voices
from scratch. And very likey less error-prone.

For keyboards in particular: It is highly advisable to use the same
voice names as they appear on the LCD screen of the keyboard.

If you used a text processor make sure you save the file as plain text
(ASCII); if you use a spreadsheet make sure you save in CVS format.


Step Two: Convert To *.rgd
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The next step involves converting the text file to the *.rgd format.
Use the provided txt2rgd.py script (in the docs/howtos directory of
the Rosegarden source distribution, or from
<URL:http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/rosegarden/docs/howtos/txt2rgd.py>) as follows:

    txt2rgd.py <input file> <output file>

E.g.:

    txt2rgd.py mylist.txt  sound_card.rgd

This script will try to catch some possible errors. If it does report any
errors then correct the offending line(s) and try again.

Notes:

 1. txt2rgd.py is a Python script, you need Python 2.2 (or above) installed
    on your system.

 2. the output file is overwritten if there was a previous version.

 3. the name of the output file must end with the ".rgd" extension.


Step Three: Verify And Adjust
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have generated the *.rgd file try to load it into Rosegarden, via
Studio -> Manage MIDI Devices -> Import Device

If it loads then you are basically done. It is likely that you may see
some bank names as "000-112". This means the the script could not find
a suitable name for the bank (the script tries to name the banks following
the XG scheme).

You can rename that bank by double-clicking on its name. When you are done
click on the "Export Device" button.

Once you are done and satisfied consider sharing it. There may be other
users with the same keyboard/soundcard and they shouldn't duplicate the work.
You can mail it to one of the Rosegarden developers, to be added to the
current library. Free software grows from community contributions.


The Advanced Section
--------------------

The *.rgd file is in gzipped XML format. You can gunzip it then edit with
any text or XML editor of your choice. If you are using vim then you don't
have to gunzip it first (it figures out for itself).

Some things you may want to change in the file:

 * In the device tag you may change the name. E.g.:

     <device id="0" name="Yamaha PSR 550" type="midi">

   (leave the id at "0")

 * After the device and before the first instrument tag you may add a
   librarian tag. E.g.:

     <librarian name="Joe Schmoe" email="Joe.Schmoe@somewere.on.the.net"/>

 * You may want to change the bank names directly here, it's easier.

Note that some chars need to be replaced with XML friendly formats.
Check the converter_table dictionary in the txt2rgd.py script for the
current list of special chars and their replacement strings.
