How to make a new release

Main steps :

1. build a tarball

2. make the tarball available on SourceForge


1. Bulding the tarball

From the top level source dir :

- edit configure.in.in and set the version number on the line AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE
- do 'make -f Makefile.cvs; make clean'

Clone (cp -R) the whole directory tree to another dir, named
rosegarden-$version (for instance, rosegarden-0.1).

cd to that new directory and do 'make dist'

the tarball should be built in the new directory, that is at
rosegarden-0.1/rosegarden-0.1.tar.gz


2. making the tarball available on SourceForge

This is the rather non-trivial step.

- copy the tarball to ftp://upload.sf.net/incoming/
- log on to SourceForge
- go to the 'admin' page of Rosegarden, then to the 'Edit/Release files' page.
  The direct URL should be :
  https://sourceforge.net/project/admin/editpackages.php?group_id=4932

- go to QRS - Quick Release a File

- fill up the form. The package name is 'rosegarden', the release name
  should simply be the version number. For the file name, you're
  offerred a selection among the lists of the files recently uploaded
  (on upload.sf.net). DO NOT select another one than the one you just
  uploaded (yes, you can actually "release" files which have nothing
  to do with the project, and this whole system suck quite a bit).

That's it, the file will be effectively available within the next few
hours.
