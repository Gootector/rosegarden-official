Starting and stopping artsd
---------------------------

Artsd starts with your UID as you log into (say) KDE.
When developing the MIDI stuff so far it's advisable to
run artsd in the foreground in a space terminal to catch any
messages its throwing out.  If you do restart artsd many client
applications may not handle the new reference at all and crash.
At the moment (6.2001) the aRts MIDI Manager (accessed through
aRts Control) is one of these.

Start artsd like this:

 % artsd -F 10 -S 4096 -a oss

When you restart artsd you'll need to recreate your midi connections.

On a default installation create the OSS midi ports by trying either
/dev/midi or /dev/midi00.

Once Rosegarden starts up it'll create two new clients labelled
Playback and Record that can be connected to OSS ports or whatever
else is available in the Midi Manager.  Avoid infinite loops by
connecting Rosegarden input to output.


Registering the Rosegarden implementations with artsd
-----------------------------------------------------

To get artsd to work with the Rosegarden MCOP implementations
we have to tweak your $HOME/.mcoprc file and restart artsd to
pick up the changes.

You need to add entries to the directory that holds these files:

  RosegardenMidiRecord.mcopclass
  libMidiArts.la

A complete example file as follows:


  # global port - we use the temp directory
  #
  #
  GlobalComm=Arts::TmpGlobalComm

  # rwb 06/01 - don't use spaces between the elements in this list
  # as aRts won't pick them up.
  #
  #
  ExtensionPath="/usr/lib","/usr/lib/mcop","/home/bownie/rosegarden/sound/"
  TraderPath="/usr/lib/mcop","/home/bownie/rosegarden/sound/"


See the note about the spaces between entries in the file!

Then restart artsd.
