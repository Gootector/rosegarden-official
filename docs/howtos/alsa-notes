Installing ALSA 0.9.0beta12 on a Mandrake 8.1 system
----------------------------------------------------
rwb 08.04.2002

Get the packages: driver, lib and utils.
Make and install - careful if you've already got aRts installed
as the new version alsa libs when installed in the default 
paths will overwrite the old libs.  Upversioned.

There is the "Mandrake devfs problem" as documented in this link:

Switching off devfs support in your lilo or grub boot menu should
fix this.
