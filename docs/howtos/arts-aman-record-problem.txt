Synth_AMAN_RECORD does not work

I'm attempting to build a simple arts device with a Synth_AMAN_RECORD
connected to a Synth_AMAN_PLAY, with the ultimate goal of making a
simple "delayed talkback" design.  I'm using arts from KDE-3.0.0 (arts
1.0.0 according to artsd).
I have two soundcards in my system, which I alternatively load
different drivers for.  One is a Soundblaster Awe64, which, when I
attempt to run arts in full-duplex, proceeds to freeze my system and
spews messages saying "buffer overrun" (or was it underrun?).  I have
used this card in Duplex-mode before, and it worked at the time,
although it is still possible that the problem has been introduced in a
new version of the driver.
The second card is a Soundblaster Live, which runs full-duplex just
fine, but no data comes out of the Synth_AMAN_RECORD.  Using the Gnome
soundrecorder program shows that I have the microphone correctly set up
and selected, as I can record waves using that application.  I can even
do recording from soundrecorder (which does not use arts) while running
arts in full-duplex AND playing mp3's from XMMS using the OSS output
module, so I'm assuming it isn't a hardware problem and it does not
appear to be a driver problem either.

I'm also not 100% convinced that it IS a duplex problem at all.  A
layout with a Synth_AMAN_RECORD and a wave output records empty wave
files (on the SBLive, anyway, I haven't tested the other card).

Just for reference, my system is a dual-celeron 366 with an Abit BP6
motherboard and 256MB of RAM running linux kernel V2.4.18.
