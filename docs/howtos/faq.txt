FAQ for Rosegarden-4
====================



Compilation or installation errors
----------------------------------


arts/artsmidi.idl not found
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You're missing the kdemultimedia package (and associated -devel
package, if appropriate to your distribution).


The Composition View
--------------------

How do I set a loop?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While holding down Shift and and the left mouse button sweep out a loop
region in the ruler at the top or bottom of the main composition window.  
The loop icon in the transport will become enabled and playback will 
always occur within this loop until you disable it.  Youu can disable
the loop by clicking on the loop icon or shift+left clicking in either
loop ruler.


How do I view the track labels?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the main window got to Setting->View Track Labels


How do I change the instrument for a track?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Click and hold the left mouse button on the track/instrument label.
A pop-up will appear from which you can choose a new instrument for
the track.

Notation and matrix editing
---------------------------


Can I edit all the segments at once in the notation editor?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The _Open in Notation Editor_ option on the main view's _Segments_
menu will open all the currently-selected segments together in a
single editor.  So to open them all, first use the _Edit_ menu's
_Select All Segments_ option, then this one.  (You can also edit a
subset of segments by selecting them with shift-click on the main
view, then using _Open in Notation Editor_.)


Can I edit all the segments at once in the matrix editor?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No.  A matrix editor shows a single segment only.


It's awfully slow.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Notation rendering is fairly slow, yes.  Unlike most other notation
applications (including Rosegarden 2.1), we render the full length of
each segment to a canvas when the notation editor starts, instead of
rendering sections at a time when it scrolls.  This means scrolling
should be smooth and quick but the initial rendering phase relatively
slow.  This can be a problem for long segments, although for other
practical reasons you're probably better off dividing long pieces into
more manageable segments anyway.

You can speed things up somewhat by switching to the RG21 font, which
doesn't look as nice but is easier to draw (though there's not yet any
way to make it the default, so you have to wait until the rendering
has happened before you can switch to it -- oops).  You can also make
scrolling smoother by switching off the chord-label ruler.

There is a particular problem with Qt 2.3.0 and anti-aliased fonts: if
you're using Qt 2.3.0 and have anti-aliased fonts enabled, rendering
performance can be dramatically slower than it should be -- even if
you aren't actually using any anti-aliased fonts in Rosegarden.  See
the Rosegarden-4 README for more details, and consider switching off
anti-aliasing or upgrading to Qt 3 (i.e. KDE 3).


Playback and recording
----------------------


Can I use an ALSA soft synth, such as iiwusynth?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yep.  Make sure you're running iiwusynth in the -alsa-seq mode and make
sure you run it up _before_ you run up Rosegarden.  They you should get
iiwusynth channels available in the Instrument dropdowns (click and hold
on the Track labels).

Start up iiwusynth something like this:

   $ iiwusynth -m alsa_seq path/to/soundfont.sf2

Then start Rosegarden and assign some Tracks to the "Synth input port"
Instrument.  By default RG will choose the onboard synth first so
you'll have to manually reassign these Tracks.
