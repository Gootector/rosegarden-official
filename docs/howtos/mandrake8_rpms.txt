Mandrake 8.0

These are the extra RPMs I had to install to get rosegarden 4.0
to build from an out-of-the-box full Mandrake 8.0 installation.
These RPMs are all taken from the two CD Mandrake 8.0 set
(normal plus ext CDs):

 zlib1-devel-1.1.3-15mdk.i586.rpm
 libarts2-devel-2.1.1-7mdk.i586.rpm
 libjpeg62-devel-6b-19mdk.i586.rpm
 libpng2-devel-1.0.9-1mdk.i586.rpm 
 alsa-lib-devel-0.5.10-2mdk

Depending on how you've installed your system you might need
to install more extra packages than this.  Make sure that you have
all the "sound" or "multimedia" related packages and their -devel-
equivalents if you're in any doubt.
