How to make a new translation for Rosegarden :

- do 'make package-messages' to ensure messages are up to date. This
will update the 'rosegarden.pot' file in the po/ directory.

- go to the po/ directory, copy 'rosegarden.pot' to the new xx.po file
you want to translate, for instance fr.po

- back to the top level, run 'make -f Makefile.cvs ; ./configure' (or
your preferred xx_configure wrapper script). This will refresh
po/Makefile so the new .po file will be taken into account.

- From now on, a 'make' in po/ will compile the message files into
.gmo files, and 'make package-messages' at top-level will update the
new po files with newly found messages as well.

XEmacs has a very good mode for po edition.

IMPORTANT NOTE : DO NOT USE QString CONCATENATION TO CREATE MESSAGES,
ALWAYS USE .arg().

E.g. this is WRONG :

QString message = i18n("Can't open file ") + filename;

And this is RIGHT :

QString message = QString(i18n("Can't open file %1")).arg(filename);
