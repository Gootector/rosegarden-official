The Lilypond export code generates a lilypond typesetting file.  You
still need to run it through lilypond (use ly2dvi -P <filename>) to
get something viewable.

Multiple tracks are laid out on separate Staffs BY NAME.  This means
that if you want different Staffs for different tracks, you need to
name the tracks differently.

Expect lots of error messages from lilypond.  Lilypond has some quirky
"features", such as the fact that you have to attach Indications to
notes (order matters), limited multiple slurs (can't start two slurs
in the same place), etc. that make it a little bit of a hack
translation from time-based sound events to typesetting.

It is sort of expected that users will "fix up" the output with any
particular typesetting features they want after export.  Adding full
lilypond control to the GUI would be unwieldy and a "concurrent
design" nightmare as we tried to keep bars, etc. the same in both
programs.  It would be an interesting problem, I suppose- let me know
if anyone thinks it's worthwhile.

And the Note() crash means that multiple segments doesn't work at the
moment- they'll all be written, but all start at time 0
(i.e. overlap).

Let me know if you have any trouble getting lilypond etc. to run.
