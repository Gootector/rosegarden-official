Rosegarden4 Coding Guidelines

Style and naming conventions

- indent 4 spaces
- data member names begin with 'm_'.
- names are capitalized (HereIsAnExample)
- class names begin with an upper case (class MyClass)
- method and variable names names begin with a lower case (int myMethod())

Language issues

- malloc()/free() and C-style arrays (that includes char*) are
explicitely forbidden except when there are no alternatives (some
external API requires it).

- C-style casts are forbidden. The only near-exception is to shut up
signed/unsigned or int/double conversion warnings, which should be
treated like this : type(value) (e.g. int(foo), unsigned(bar)...)

- When given the choice, prefer STL containers to Qt ones.

- Use std::string whenever possible (e.g. in core), QString only when
you need to deal with Qt widgets, or need some of its features (like
regexps).

- public data members are forbidden except in very trivial
classes. Provide accessors.

- use 'protected' instead of 'private'.
