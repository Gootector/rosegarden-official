Tuplets
=======

Tuplet is a general term for series of notes played with durations
(usually) shorter than the nominal durations of the drawn notes.  The
obvious example is the triplet, in which three notes are played in the
time of two.

The terminology we use in Rosegarden 4 is: a Tuplet is a single note
within one of these series; Tupled Group (which is a special sort of
Beamed Group -- see sets.txt) is the name for the whole series.  Each
tuplet has a nominal duration, which is the duration of the note as
drawn on the score (e.g. triplet quavers have a nominal one-quaver
duration), and an effective duration, which is the duration of the
note as performed (e.g. two-thirds of a quaver).

Rosegarden 2.1 stored tuplets with their nominal type and duration,
plus some information that could be used to calculate the effective
duration.

For Rosegarden 4, in which each event has a starting time as well as a
duration (RG2.1's events were just a contiguous series, and didn't
store a starting time) it makes more sense to ensure that the starting
times of the tuplets and of the first event after the tupled group are
consistent with the stored durations.  For this reason, Rosegarden 4
stores the effective duration of each tuplet, and records the nominal
duration separately in an event property.

The complete set of properties associated with a tupled note or rest:

 -- Event's normal absolute time and duration

    These store the performance time and duration, so for example
    the duration is 2/3 of a quaver's duration if the group is
    made up of quaver triplets.

    The absolute time would be slightly complicated to calculate
    from the other properties, but the duration could be calculated
    from the nominal duration and the tupled and untupled lengths
    of the group.

 -- BaseProperties::BEAMED_GROUP_ID
    BaseProperties::BEAMED_GROUP_TYPE

    Indicate membership of the group.

 -- BaseProperties::TUPLET_NOMINAL_DURATION

    The "display" duration of the event, for example the duration
    of a quaver if the group is made up of quaver triplets.

    This could be calculated from the duration of the event and
    the tupled and untupled lengths of the group -- although there
    may be some rounding error.

 -- BaseProperties::BEAMED_GROUP_TUPLED_LENGTH
    The total duration of the group as performed, for example the
    duration of a crotchet if the group is made up of quaver triplets.

 -- BaseProperties::BEAMED_GROUP_UNTUPLED_LENGTH
    The total duration of the group as displayed, for example the
    duration of a dotted crotchet if the group is made up of quaver
    triplets.

 -- BaseProperties::BEAMED_GROUP_TUPLED_COUNT
    Number to be drawn on the tupling line.

(The effective duration is not necessarily exact, although for
triplets it will be.  Our base unit of time was originally 6 units to
1 hemidemisemiquaver, which meant triplets were the only tuplets that
could be guaranteed an exact representation; it's since been increased
to 60 units to the hemidemi, giving various other sorts of tuplets a
good chance of exactness, and at least a "good enough" approximation
for the listener.)
