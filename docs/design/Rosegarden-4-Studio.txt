The Studio
==========

The (virtual) Studio is a concept that allows the user to create
and manipulate virtual instruments and virtual connections in the
Rosegarden world.  MIDI and audio datastreams can be connected 
to each other to sources and to sinks and to virtual devices within
the Studio.

The initial design for the Rosegarden-4 Studio was inspired by the 
virtual instruments that many leading sequencers employ along with
the so-called "Environment" layers that professional sequencers
implement.  These layers allow a level of virtual functionality
that operates solely in software.

The first component of the Studio to be properly implemented are audio
volume faders and associated plugin lists.
