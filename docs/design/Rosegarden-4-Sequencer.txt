The Sequencer
=============

The Rosegarden-4 sequencer is comprises of code from two directories
in the rosegarden CVS tree.  Of course there's the code in the
rosegarden/sequencer which defines the application itself and top
level behaviours as well as the vital DCOP interface it uses to
communicate with the Rosegarden main process.  Additionally there
is code in two libraries built out of the rosegarden/sound
directory.  These are libRosegardenSequencer and libRosegardenSound.

RosegardenSequencer library
===========================

SoundDriver and related code that the sequencer alone is interested
in.  Conditional compilation occurs according to the type of sound
support required.  ALSA, JACK and aRts are supported at the sequencer.
ALSA and aRts are mutually exclusive options - JACK is an additional
option for the ALSA sequencer.

The ALSA/JACK combination is the preferred and better supported. 


RosegardenSound library
=======================

Contains MappedComposition and other Mapped definitions (includind
MappedObject and MappedStudio).  Also PeakFile generation and
management code.  WAV/RIFF/BWF file format handling.  MidiFile
handling as well.   This library is required by the main 
Rosegarden process as well as the Sequencer itself.
