Since I have just committed an extremely radical restructuring of the menu
system, I think it fitting to document the reasoning behind everything I did.

Especially notable changes:

Several top level menus have been pulled down into other menus.  The Move and
Transport menus in the matrix and notation editors are mostly full of actions
I expect most people to do with toolbars or keyboard shortcuts.  They don't
rate a place on the top, and pulling them down reduces clutter.

The entire Studio has been pulled into the new Document menu, and various
Document-related items have been pulled out of Edit and into Document.  All
Document-related functions in the matrix/notation editors are on Document now;
namely the tempo/time actions, which are indeed global to the document.

The notation editor has lost many top level menus.  Arguably the menus are
more annoying to navigate now because some actions require negotiating three
layers instead of two.  However, gone is any ambiguity about whether, for
example, a tie is a group or a mark or a transform.  It doesn't move a note
anywhere or physically alter its duration in any way, so it will be found on
Note with all its like-minded brethren.


The standard arrangement of menus is:

File Edit View Document Segment [Extras] Tools Settings Help

Each top level menu has a specific purpose we should stick to as closely as
possible.  Generally they are:

File     - actions that affect file management, such as loading/saving,
           importing/exporting, and because it's the universal standard
	   location, printing

Edit     - actions that affect selections, such as select, cut, copy, paste, etc.

View     - actions that affect the current view

Document - actions that affect the document globally and which are unique to
           the document, such as tempo/time, the entire Studio, and all the
	   document length/properties functions

Segments - actions that affect either the selected segment(s) or the segment
           actively being edited

Tools    - things like the various edit cursors, the local cursor control
           menus, the transport menus, and various other miscellany.

Settings - settings which affect Rosegarden globally, and the various
           toolbar/ruler toggles

Specific to the notation editor:

Notes:   - these are actions that affect the visual appearance of a note
           without physically moving it; this sweeping category includes
	   beams, ties, tuplets, grace notes, slashes, marks, etc. 

Transforms
         - these are actions that alter the note in some way, by respelling
	   it, transposing it, decounterpointing it, interpreting it, etc. and
	   also where "tie notes at barlines" is found, even though this one
	   really doesn't quite fit into either the "Notes" or "Transforms"
	   categories as set forth here.
