0.2, beta and beyond
====================

[25th July 2002]

The plan is to have two releases of RG - the first tentatively booked for the
9th August will be 0.2 and have all major functionality required of a 
reasonable sequencer, from our perspective these tasks are:

o Audio completed - perhaps some LADSPA plugins but certainly audio volume
  and basic audio effects (split, combine audio segments, fade in and fade
  out)

o Supported extra MIDI events (CC, PC, SysEx still outstanding) and some
  form of representation on screen

o Matrix view completion - sweep selection, quantisation and instrument
  parameter style box for matrix events, fixing insertion and outstanding
  bugs

o Recording toggle rather than recording start just starting

o Event list - Spacey might get involved, he might not, in the meantime 
  knocking up a putative event list with a QFileView is pretty simple and
  we could use the existing Event editor for modifying parameters.
  Basic filtering on Event list for Event type.

o Automatic RG file backups ('n' copies of old file)

Looking at 0.2_planned_tasks this list seems to tie-in quite well.  At a 
push I think this is probably acheivable - this will all be at a push of
course!

Ok, so that's up to the 9th - that will be the basic feature set we need.
From the 9th until the end of the month it's going to be polishing and
tweaking these features and generally cutting out the bugs, using,
recording, editing and starting to work with the whole thing to make sure
it's of high enough quality and sane enough to actually use.  Then a feature
freeze at the end of August until the end of September during that time we
should polish further and encourage more testing and feedback towards an
official beta release.  Bug fixes only and more polishing until we're happy
enough to release sometime in September - possibly call this release 0.8 or
less depending on our level of happiness with it.  Considering that
sequencer-wise there's still potentially a load to do we should make
this call closer to the time.

So, hopefully by the end of Sept most of the RG code will be ready enough
for a good user release/beta.
