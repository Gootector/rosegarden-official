Task List
This file is organized roughly in order of when I'm likely to get to it.

Bugs:
-----
1) Update and correct this task list
2) Default output file name same as current .rg filename
3) refactor lilypond Voice assignments (arguably necessary)
-use automatic voicing (\\{ } )
-requires support code- sort voices by time and make sure they all get inserted at once

Features:
---------
1) HOWTO importers/exporters
2) publish i18n general plea for help
3) recruit/initial stab at more languages
4) More importers/exporters
- finish lily input
- find a way to test musicXML output

Silvan?
5) GUI for lilypond export
- map tracks to lilypond staves manually rather than based on name (maybe config setting)
- Title etc. info settings
6) Paper settings for lilypond output

Want to do, someone else will probably get there first
------------------------------------------------------
1) Split note for midi input (see rg-user from end of dec/beginning jan)
