Task List
This file is organized roughly in order of when I'm likely to get to it.

Bugs:
-----
1) Update and correct this task list
2) Default output file name same as current .rg filename
3) escape lilypond text output (i.e. title, etc)
- latex barfs on _, silvan reported & is bad, etc.
- why is QString.replace private?
4) (in progress) clean up note naming
-move notationtypes note string stuff to gui/
-cleanse base/ of all but reference note names
-ask chris(?) about style file (note names)
5) refactor lilypond Voice assignments
-use automatic voicing (\\{ } )
-requires support code- sort voices by time and make sure they all get inserted at once

Features:
---------
1) Start internationalization
2) publish i18n howto and general plea for help
3) lilypond text events (see sforge bug)
4) HOWTO importers/exporters
5) GUI for lilypond export
- map tracks to lilypond staves manually rather than based on name (maybe config setting)
- Title etc. info settings
6) More importers/exporters
- finish lily input
- find a way to test musicXML output

Want to do, someone else will probably get there first
------------------------------------------------------
1) Split note for midi input (see rg-user from end of dec/beginning jan)

Prefer not to do, but probably should
-------------------------------------
1) Paper settings for lilypond output
