Possible features and work for release 0.2
==========================================

Three categories: Work required to finish basic features that are
already started; new features that are suitable for the 0.2 timeframe;
basis work for features that won't appear until later.


Work required to fix existing stuff
-----------------------------------

1.  updating one edit window when something is edited in another
    (however crudely we do it at first).  -- at the moment if you
    delete a note in one window then insert in another, it crashes
    [carried over from 0.1]

2.  better time signature support.  The way things are at the
    moment, if you insert a time sig into a track it gets copied
    into all other tracks (correctly) but if you then move one of
    the tracks they become out of sync again.  Better to store
    time sigs in the Composition's reference track only, and save
    them to file from there.  Probably a good case for having
    notation elements without corresponding events (because the
    time sig event will never be copied to individual tracks)


New features suitable for 0.2
-----------------------------

1.  selection

2.  undo
