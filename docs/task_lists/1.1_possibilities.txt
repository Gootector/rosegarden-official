Features for 1.1, or at least post-1.0
======================================

Just somewhere to write down random feature suggestions for after the
1.0 release.  As much as anything, the point is simply to know that a
feature has been "listed" while avoiding the temptation to do it
quickly for 1.0.

(This is supposed to be a bit more vague and general than the
SourceForge feature requests tracker.)


General
-------

 * Scripting API!

 * Beat location and tempo tracking in MIDI (and audio?).


Notation etc
------------

 * Performable ornaments!  Finally.  Generic macros of that type.

 * Micro-tuned key signatures.  Oh, the possibilities.

 * Drum staffs.

 * Guitar tab (not something that interests me, but I'm sure it'd
   interest Guillaume).

 * Multi-voice staffs, by overlaying segments.

 * Different spacing algorithms.  One could have a menu of three or
   four likely candidates.

 * Better synchronisation in x-coord of elements in different staffs,
   without reverting to a completely naive layout.  This is probably
   harder than either of the two foregoing.  Each bar record (per
   staff) can contain a series of duration/spacing pairs for timed
   events, but how to reconcile them?

 * Lilypond import.  Ignore those, ahem, lily-livered milquetoasts
   who suggest it'd be "really damn difficult" or any of that rot.

 * better integration of fluidsynth/softsynths
