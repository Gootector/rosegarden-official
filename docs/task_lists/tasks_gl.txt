Current Task list
======================================

--

1.0 stuff :

- save & restore dialog sizes, ListView layout DONE (on the dialogs which may be useful to resize)
- use KConfigGroupSaver
- fix MIDI import CAN'T REPRODUCE PROBLEMS
- 'add' features in Control Rulers DONE
- rgapp->sequencer(Send|Call) DONE

--

- control rulers events draggable x-wise

- make clipboard app-wide instead of doc-wide (move it to RosegardenGUIApp).

- "stacked toolboxes" widget (something like Mozilla's left sidebar,
but smaller and able to show (fold/unfold) several boxes at once).

- fill up docs/sanity-test.txt

- soundfont load at startup

- implement auto-extend of track editor's canvas when moving a segment
beyond the canvas' boundary.

- harmonize namings of m_view* toggle actions, slotToggleXXX(), slotShowXXX()
 (m_viewSegmentParameters / slotToggleSegmentParameters / slotShowSegmentParameters)

- valgrind/kcachegrind - ok

- show selected zones à la RG2.1

- audio peak files in tmp. dir with hashed names

- menu item status (enabled/disabled) - ongoing work...

- better error report when failing to load a resource

- look at lazy note pixmap rendering again (see
gui/qcanvassimplesprite.h r1.18, qcanvassimplesprite.cpp r1.20,
notationstaff.cpp r1.146).

- guitar chord display

- AA text on canvas

- use KFilterBase/KFilterDev for accessing .rg files (rather than calling zlib directly)

- windows 'linking' : linked windows would keep in synch which part of the segment they show


"Done" stuff
======================================

- RPM building - taken over by nice volunteers

- try to improve sequencer latency problems (GUI & seq. should mmap a
tmp file which would hold easy-to-parse event data. File should have
lines of fixed length). DONE

- add signals for progress reporting in layout classes DONE

- use a QWidgetStack for the InstrumentParameterBox DONE

- auto-scroll in matrix (and piano keyb widget too ?) DONE

- optimize segment overlap shading - DONE

- fix toolbar pos. saving - DONE

- fix wait cursors - DONE (upgrade to Qt 3.0.5)

- daily compile check for various confing options (DONE - mostly, I run it by hand from time to time)

- Matrix undo DONE

- insertion in the middle of rests DONE (by Chris)

- look for a way to represent overlapping segments DONE

- look if note pixmaps gain from being turned into real QCanvasItems - PROBABLY NOT

- look to use a pixmap cache for notation - CHRIS SAYS IT WON'T HELP

- printing (at least the beginnings of it) - DONE

- make MIDI pitch->string convertion configurable - DONE

- make matrix tools use shift modifier for smoth move - DONE

- tidy up exceptions, make a Rosegarden::Exception class - DONE by Chris

- have several kdDebug() channels - DONE

References in round brackets are to 0.1_planned_features.txt.

* Take up all following rests into account when inserting a note (rest collapsing function ?) - moved to tasks_cc and DONE

* when replacing a rest, split it according to where the click
