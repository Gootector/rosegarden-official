Known Bugs
==========

 - MIDI file tempos aren't working yet

 - occasional gui/sequencer hangs while DCOP call in progress [STILL AN ISSUE?]

 - sending All Notes Off to aRts when they're already queued?
   More a feature than a bug - waiting for aRts to support it.

Fixed Bugs
==========

 - playback currently stumbling and poor [FIXED - note off queue was filling up
   and getting all out of shape]
