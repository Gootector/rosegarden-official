0.2 tasks
=========

o Matrix Parameter Box [SKELETON]

o Event list [GETTING THERE]

o Get Segment joining working

o Repeating Notes bug

o More MIDI events at Composition level. Sys Exs, Program Changes,
  Controller changes etc. etc.

o Audio volume faders - studio concept on sequencer

o Segment previews still buggy [BETTER but still a glitch]

o Tidy up AudioFiles:
   - hardcoded format segment values
   - BWF format writing/reading
   - exceptions and return values

o Realtime downsampling buggy (8 bit)

o Prove and improve simultaneous audio and MIDI track performance
  Improve performance:
   - file access
   - maths in JACK and MIDI loops
   - memory usage and access
   - build without debug and test

o First time run up go to settings and walk user through the
  MIDI and Audio setup to help them understand what they're
  doing.

o "Revert file" option

o sweep selection on Matrix

o Matrix view auto scrolling

o Complete segment edit shortcuts (click/copy/multiple segment drag)

-------------------------- MUCH OLDER STUFF ----------------------------

Pre 0.1.4 work

o Recording mechanism
  - mute and record buttons on tracks   [DONE]
  - arm tracks for record               [DONE]

o Audio [See above]

    [HANDLED - but more work eventually required to support at MIDI file
     and internal rep level]




Task list from 18/19th August meetings (and a few more added since)
===================================================================

Aim: "working sequencer, framework for instrument management".

References in round brackets are to 0.1_planned_features.txt.

 1. MIDI file writing (A10)             [DONE]
    - [DONE] :  Composition to internal MIDI REP processing
             :  Output File Creation
             :  MIDI File Header Writing
   
    - [ DONE] :  Meta Track Generation
                       :  MIDI Byte out processing

 2. DCOP API for sequencer process
     - getSlice (MappedEvents)          [DONE]
     - stop/start/play/record           [DONE]

 3. Componentising Sequencer application from earlier
    prototypes (fleshing out the basic features)     [DONE]

 3. Skeleton Transport controls and first keyboard mappings. [DONE]

 4. Position pointer on GUI trackseditor. [DONE]

 5. Remove MappedComposition from core/ and put
    into RosegardenSound lib  [DONE]

 6. Ensuring MIDI file conversions are correct (read MIDI,
    save as RG, plays OK) [ DONE ]

 7. Tightening up Sequencer loop - make playback more efficient [DONE]

 8. Ensuring that Tempo is used correctly throughout Editor and Sequencer. [DONE]


0.1 Known Bugs
==============

 - MIDI file tempos aren't working yet [FIXED]

 - occasional gui/sequencer hangs while DCOP call in progress [FIXED]

 - sending All Notes Off to aRts when they're already queued?
   More a feature than a bug - waiting for aRts to support it. [CAN'T YET SUPPORT]

0.1 Fixed Bugs
==============

 - playback currently stumbling and poor [FIXED - note off queue was filling up
   and getting all out of shape]
