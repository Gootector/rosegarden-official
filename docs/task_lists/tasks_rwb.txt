0.2 TO-DO for rwb
-----------------
updated 05.02.2001

Currently looking at:

o Playing Audio files
  o synchronisation with MIDI [SITUATION IMPROVED]
  o clearing down handles without crashing aRTS [STILL BUGGY]

o Sequencer memory leak

o SoundFile file reading debacle

o Looping at the origin - Looping bug?

o End of loop flyback sends duplicate copies of start of loop events

o bar and loop ruler bar widths for partial bars

o tidy up getSequencerSlice and MappedEvent [MappedEvent DONE]

o Metronome [PENDING getBarRange fix]


==


o Track addition/deletion and moving on TrackButtons canvas - needs undo!
  
o Complete segment edit shortcuts (click/copy/multiple segment drag)

o Segment colouring

o Instrument display - aRTS environment, MIDI/Audio assignable
  parameters

o More MIDI events at Composition level. Sys Exs, Program Changes,
  Controller changes etc. etc.

o Segment Zooming - (midi and audio previews of Segments)

o Segment paramters and modifiers - looping of Segments, quantisation

o Allow negative time on segment canvas and transport

o Audio noise eliminator - recording

o Audio output VU meters

o MIDI CC, PC and sysex handling


Recently completed/fixed
------------------------

- rg file saving is still broken for some trivial cases (Segments wrong size)
    [FIXED with recent segmentcanvas changes]

- Bar lines widget (similar to TrackButtons).
  Implementation to allow for:

  - Looping [DONE]

  - Start and End Markers for Composition growth and shrinkage [ALMOST DONE]

- basic MIDI recording [DONE]

- Write Rosegarden tempo events to exported MIDI [DONE]

- MIDI output VU meters and Transport feedback [DONE]

- Audio file support in rg file. [DONE]
  Audio WAV file header authentification [DONE]
  Audio Segments [DONE]
  Audio playing proof of concept [DONE]
  Audio recording proof of concept [DONE]
  Sequencing of plain Audio files [DONE]

- Segment movement resolution [CC]

- Recording segments - trails [DONE]



-------------------------- MUCH OLDER STUFF ----------------------------




Post 0.1 work
=============

o Transport GUI with time, buttons and more features [DONE]

o Recording mechanism
  - mute and record buttons on tracks   [DONE]
  - arm tracks for record               [DONE]

o Audio [See above]

o Handle Meta Events at the Editor and Midi levels - write then out to file
    [HANDLED - but more work eventually required to support at MIDI file
     and internal rep level]




Task list from 18/19th August meetings (and a few more added since)
===================================================================

Aim: "working sequencer, framework for instrument management".

References in round brackets are to 0.1_planned_features.txt.

 1. MIDI file writing (A10)             [DONE]
    - [DONE] :  Composition to internal MIDI REP processing
             :  Output File Creation
             :  MIDI File Header Writing
   
    - [ DONE] :  Meta Track Generation
                       :  MIDI Byte out processing

 2. DCOP API for sequencer process
     - getSlice (MappedEvents)          [DONE]
     - stop/start/play/record           [DONE]

 3. Componentising Sequencer application from earlier
    prototypes (fleshing out the basic features)     [DONE]

 3. Skeleton Transport controls and first keyboard mappings. [DONE]

 4. Position pointer on GUI trackseditor. [DONE]

 5. Remove MappedComposition from core/ and put
    into RosegardenSound lib  [DONE]

 6. Ensuring MIDI file conversions are correct (read MIDI,
    save as RG, plays OK) [ DONE ]

 7. Tightening up Sequencer loop - make playback more efficient [DONE]

 8. Ensuring that Tempo is used correctly throughout Editor and Sequencer. [DONE]


0.1 Known Bugs
==============

 - MIDI file tempos aren't working yet [FIXED]

 - occasional gui/sequencer hangs while DCOP call in progress [FIXED]

 - sending All Notes Off to aRts when they're already queued?
   More a feature than a bug - waiting for aRts to support it. [CAN'T YET SUPPORT]

0.1 Fixed Bugs
==============

 - playback currently stumbling and poor [FIXED - note off queue was filling up
   and getting all out of shape]
