Features for 1.0 - updated 20030627
-----------------------------------

- banks/variations [cc]

- tidy up audio parameter box [cc/rwb/gl]

- ALSA ports [cc]

- general file merging [cc]

- multiple document interface (switcheable buffers, loading while playing) [rwb]

- playlists (essential for demos!) [rwb]

- song markers - jumping to, creating loops between [rwb]

- search facility for patch sounds (search all banks) [rwb]

- request: notation segment expanding itself as you enter 
           notes past the end of it

- request: importing lilypond after manual hackery?
  dmm:  No, I don't think so.  I saw the exchange Hans had on the
  lilypond-devel list some time ago, and this feature would be extremely
  difficult to implement.  If Hans has been working on it all this time in
  secret, then it might make 1.0, but otherwise there's not a chance.

- request: triplets of more than three (erm, quintuplets?)

- Studio faders (MIDI and audio fader controls)

- porting to shared memory experimental branch [rwb/cc/gl]

- event filter dialog [dmm] [DONE]

- document event filter dialog in RG manual [dmm] [DONE]

- look at other updates for RG manual [dmm] [IN PROGRESS]
    
- request: import studio from file [dmm] [IN PROGRESS]

- request: use studio from file instead of default [dmm] [IN PROGRESS]

- implement Pitch in lilypondio in parallel with existing methods, so we can
  eventually wean it off of the junky code it currently uses. [dmm/hk]

- look at the "Chord" class for Lilypond and see how it might help resolve
  the weird "measures that just don't add up" problems I've been seeing
  [dmm/hk]

- named controllers for studio with associated bankeditor-like dialog [dmm/rwb]
  [IN PROGRESS]

- find decent home for event filter toolbar icons [cc? dmm?]

- fix step recording icon?  little feet would be more intuitive to me than
  the arrow thing Chris came up with...  Chris??  [dmm]

- completely rewrite tutorial for 1.0, using fewer/smaller pixmaps, better
  organization, possibly converting to LDP docbook format [dmm]

- request: integration of fluidsynth

Bugs
----

Many - but additional ones are:

- audio cutting and moving is right off
- select a load of notes in the matrix view and quantize - the
  view screws up quite a bit.
- can't move the start time of a segment
- Repeating segment ghosts when moving them.
- segment preview ghosts when moving them
