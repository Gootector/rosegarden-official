Ideas for contributors
======================

If you're thinking of contributing to Rosegarden, we'd prefer you to
work on something that interests you.  You're more likely to stick at
it, and more likely to be able to tell how good a job you're doing.

But, in case you're itching to contribute some code and you really
can't decide what you'd like to do, here are some ideas.  (Anything
listed on one of our general task lists that isn't also on one of our
personal task lists may be a good candidate, too.)

These are all things that we would like to see implemented but feel
unlikely to get around to doing ourselves.  As such, they're likely to
be tedious or hard work, because if they were interesting and easy
we'd be happy to do them.  Don't feel you ought to work on anything
from this list if it doesn't interest you: find something you really
want to do instead.


Tasks suggested by Chris (notation guy):

 -- Various import/export filters.  These are usually boring to
 implement, but they're quite useful and help you learn a reasonable
 amount about the way the data structures work.  Good candidates
 include import of Finale ETF files (see
 http://www.cs.uu.nl/~hanwen/lily-devel/etf.html and various sample
 files at http://www.cpdl.org), import of Brahms files, and export of
 Lilypond typesetting files.  ETF is difficult, Brahms should be easy,
 and the Lilypond format is probably best done by someone who's
 already very familiar with Lilypond (or who really wants to learn all
 about it).

 -- We're lacking an event list window, and I'd also like to see a
 window for viewing and editing the properties of a single event,
 accessible from the notation view.


Tasks suggested by Bownie (MIDI and audio guy):

 -- an audio (waveform) editor.  I've talked to the bloke who runs
 kwave and he's not really up to much with it at the moment, might
 eventually make a kparts thingy out of it but he's talking about next
 year.  We would want to use the aRTS extensible plugin architecture
 for effects stacks so it'd be a really interesting and rewarding part
 of the project.  I would do it myself but there's so much else
 Instrument/Environment-wise to come to support all that fun stuff.

 -- Someone should investigate and implement the LADSPA plugins as
 well (www.plugin.org.uk, www.ladspa.org).
