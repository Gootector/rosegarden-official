20020225 meeting notes [cc, rwb] for device/bank rework
-------------------------------------------------------

From the user perspective:

 * Current bank/program dialog remains (renamed from Manage Devices
   to something like Manage Banks, Manage Programs or Manage Presets).

 * Bank/program dialog allows editing of banks and programs for each
   device but nothing else (not adding or removing devices, not
   renaming devices, nothing).

 * New Manage Devices dialog which enumerates the devices (a list
   of names entirely under the user's control -- user can add, remove
   and rename) and associates each with a "Connection" (chosen from a
   dropdown of ALSA ports) and "Channels" (All or a subset of 1-16).
   Connection and Channels are settable in this dialog.

 * The default list of Devices (when you start up a fresh install of
   RG) contains one per ALSA port, with some dummy names and a GM map
   on each.

 * Instrument dropdown offers one entry per Device, and where a Device
   listens on more than one channel, it offers a submenu of Instruments
   corresponding to the channels for that Device.

From the code perspective:

 * Current Device classes remain, but internally become associated
   with ALSA Port + Channel Map instead of ALSA Client.

 * Current Instrument classes remain more or less unchanged.

 * Devices continue to have only user-provided name and a number
   counted up from zero -- i.e. the connection between Device and
   Port/Channel Map is entirely reconfigurable -- how does this
   affect saving/loading?  Save .rg files with the current config
   for Connections in them, but permit reload regardless of whether
   they match the current setup or not?
