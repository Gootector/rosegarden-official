it can provide as much or as little as it wants to. when its set the
current time, it provides a bitfield indicating what is valid (its
part of the struct).

when you retrieve the information, you must check the bitfield to see
what is valid.

what happens is that the timebase client sets only the "pending time",
and at the end of the entire process() cycle, the engine updates the
"current time" with the pending time. thus, at the start of the next
cycle, everyone is on the same page, so to speak. neat, eh?
