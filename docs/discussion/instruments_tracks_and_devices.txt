Instruments, Tracks and Devices
[rwb 13.3.2002]

On examination of a few other pieces of software and after having
a bit of a think the following model for implementing Instruments
and Tracks seems like a good starting point.

We start from the notion of Audio and Midi Devices.

An AudioDevice provides a mechanism by which an Audio Segment can
be played.  The AudioDevice will provide details of the number
of available simultaneous channels that it supports and other
information that might be pertinent to playback (latency, plugin
features etc).  An AudioDevice channel will be equivalent to a
single entry on a Track's Instrument selection menu

A MidiDevice is a mechanism by which a Midi/Internal Rep. Segment
can be played.  The MidiDevice will provide details of the number
of available channels (usually 16) and other information pertinent
information.  A MidiDevice will have parameters available for the
setting of System Exclusive states and other device-global parameters.
MidiDevice channel will be equivalent to a single entry on the
Instrument selection menu.

There can be many MidiDevices and many AudioDevices in a single
application.

A single entry on a Track's Instrument selection menu will be known
as an Instrument.

All Instruments have a unique identifying number.

Instruments will be of type Midi or type Audio.

Instruments are created by AudioDevices and MidiDevices.  For the moment
Instruments will be automatically created (16 MIDI instruments to a MIDI
device and an arbitrary number of audio Instruments) because of the absence
of query or mapping mechanism in the underlying sound API (aRts).

A Track will have no notion of whether it's Audio or Midi.  Only the
Instrument mapped to that Track will define the type.  Then this type
will be used for performance or recording purposes.

Both the Device and the Instrument will have performance parameters
(Program, Channel, Volume, Delay etc).  Where overlaps of these
parameters occur the Instrument's parameters override those of the
Device.  In this way a MidiDevice provides default values for all
Instruments.  The Instruments themselves can modify these parameters
via the InstrumentParameterBox (GUI element on the TrackEditor) i.e.

 A MidiDevice by default assigns 1 single MIDI channel to each Instrument
 and assigns Programs (MIDI "voices") 0-15 to the Instruments.  These can
 be modified at the MidiDevice or directly overridden by the specific
 Instrument.  In the case that Program Changes are not simple General
 MIDI there will also be Bank Select messages available.


Instrument list
---------------

MidiDevices and AudioDevices generate and own their Instrument lists.
Instruments are numbered and grouped by type (from 1000 for Audio
and from 2000 for MIDI).  System Instruments (Metrnome etc) start 
from 0.

Instruments are accessed through the Studio and are seen as a 
canonical list even though they may be spread over many different
Devices.

Tracks are mapped to Instruments by InstrumentId.  On saving to XML
the Tracks save this InstrumentId with them.  The Instruments themselves
are not yet saved - only the Devices and programs (with bank selects).
