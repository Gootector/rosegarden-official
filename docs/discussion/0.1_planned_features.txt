Features for release 0.1

1. features without which nobody will even believe we're serious

- be able to store music in multiple tracks and display multiple
  tracks (one notation window per track) : DONE

- updating one edit window when something is edited in another
  (however crudely we do it at first).  -- at the moment if you
  delete a note in one window then insert in another, it crashes

- track part deletion : DONE

- proper saving/restoring of track part start time DONE

- note insertion (by replacing rests) : DONE

- note deletion

- proper handling of time sigs. Tracks should be positioned at
  absolute steps, not bars.

- all the notation elegances (more precise description needed here)

- be able to both read and write MIDI files, even if we only handle
  the most basic events

- basic MIDI record and playback infrastructure through aRts (RB - 18.06.01)

- the basics of Rosegarden 2.1 file loading


2. the basis for more advanced features, where that basis should be
done as soon as possible

- undo stack

- multiple editor windows on a same track

- "environments" à la Logic.

- selection/deletion/editing etc of single events and groups thereof

- track properties dialog

- setting the time default sig of newly created tracks
  (and selecting the appropriate sort of rest to fill up the tracks
  with -- and should it be possible to change the rest type for a whole
  filled section at once, after the fact?)

- moveable begin and end markers in tracks

- show several tracks in a single notation window


3. cleaning up the code and organisation such that it's as pleasant as
possible for other people to read and work with

- sort the source files in rosegardengui a bit better (core/,
  gui/main/, gui/notation/, gui/trackedit)

- do a global core + rosegardengui Makefile

- clean up XML code so that it's not spread over RosegardenGUIDoc and
  RoseXMLHandler
