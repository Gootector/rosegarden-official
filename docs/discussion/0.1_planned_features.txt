Features for release 0.1

- be able to store music in multiple tracks and display multiple
  tracks (however basic that display may be)

- updating one edit window when something is edited in another
  (however crudely we do it at first).  -- at the moment if you
  delete a note in one window then insert in another, it crashes

- track part deletion

- proper saving/restoring of track part start time

- be able to both read and write MIDI files, even if we only handle
  the most basic events

- note insertion (by replacing rests)

- note deletion

- sort the source files in rosegardengui a bit better (core/,
  gui/main/, gui/notation/, gui/trackedit)

- do a global core/rosegardengui Makefile


Nice to have :

- loading Rosegarden 2.1 files

- selection/deletion/editing etc of single events and groups thereof

- all the notation elegances (more precise description needed here)
